When the tapping stops or goes over a certain period of time, Noan: Arca will perform Gear-Break Combo based on the color of Signal Orbs pinged, and its DMG will depend on the current Gear Level. Triggering a Combo Strike also consumes all Rising Energy charged to increase its DMG dealt. The Rising Energy consumed will be converted into Rotational Speed. The next time Gear-Break Combo is triggered, if the current Rising Energy exceeds Rotational Speed, Gear Level will go up by 1. If Gear-Break Combo is triggered at Gear Lv.3, it will turn into Assault-Rising Combo with an increased Extra DMG Bonus. Rotational Speed and Gear Level will be reset afterward.

Bianca: Stigmata is unable to trigger Matrix via Dodge. When her weapon is in Staff Form, press and hold Dodge to perform Simulated Matrix and activate Luminous Realm. While Luminous Realm is active, pinging Signal Orbs can also consume the Afterglow Orbs that are of the same color and aligned above them, upon which Glowing Lanternlight will be unleashed to deal Physical DMG to enemies within range; pinging Signal Orbs and Afterglow Orbs will both generate Afterglow Points.
