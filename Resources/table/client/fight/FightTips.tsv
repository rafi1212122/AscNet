11150434	1		Colder than seawater, harder than icebergs.		
11150435	1		Calorie intake is limited to 1,164 kcals per day. These are your rations for today.		
11150436	1		Children are treated as adults without any special privileges.		
11150437	1		The book says that people will die from hunger if they have nothing to eat.

11150443	1		Compared with land, Atlantis is only a grain of dust.		
11150444	1		There are many, many Atlantis on land with many, many people living inside.		
11150446	1		Unlike Atlantis, they don't have stacks of rules on land.

11150666	1		And her condition?
