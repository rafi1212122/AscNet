9	9		301							1		Rosetta hops off the CUB and responds to Asimov on the comms.																						
10	10		301								Rosetta	That won't be necessary.	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	Something has happened between you two, I assume.	2																					
12	12		301								Rosetta	Yes. I want to keep it this way a little longer. I think it'll be better for us if we help each other as individuals.	1																					
13	13		301								Asimov	That's what Combat Unit Boosters are designed for.	2																					
14	14		301								Rosetta	Combat Unit Booster...	1																					
15	15		301								Rosetta	Asimov, does it have a name?	1																					
16	16		301								Asimov	No. After all, it's not like other CUBs. Most of the data is unique to your centaur module.	2																					
17	17		301								Asimov	As I said before, you're the most suitable candidate.	2																					
18	18		301								Rosetta	I see...	1																					
19	19		301									Rosetta looks at the CUB, lost in thought. A moment later, she quietly utters a phrase.																						
20	20		301								Rosetta	Frost Oath...	1																					
21	21		301								Asimov	Sorry?	2																					
22	22		301								Rosetta	Frost Oath.	1																					
23	23		301									The CUB standing off to the side nods slightly. Rosetta quickly realizes the meaning behind the gesture.																						
24	24		301									She takes a step forward, then gently places her forehead on the CUB's forehead.																						
25	25		301								Rosetta	Frost Oath... The snow and storm has witnessed our vows to each other.	1																					
26	26		301								Asimov	Frost Oath, is it? I'll enter it into the file.	2																					
27	27		301								Diana	What happened, Rosetta?																						
28	28		301									Diana's inquiry can be heard coming from the direction of the camp, interrupting the conversation between Rosetta and Asimov.																						
29	29		301								Asimov	You can go. I'll have someone else collect the equipment.	2																					
30	30		301								Asimov	Just one more thing. Temporary integration is still within the scope of our technology. You can always ask me to recalibrate it should the need arise during an operation.	2																					
31	31		301								Asimov	I don't think Frost Oath will have any objections.	2

41	41		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After saying goodbye to Asimov, Rosetta leads Frost Oath in the direction of Diana and the Forest Guard.																						
42	42		301									Now that the blizzard had subsided, the sunlight shines all the more radiantly.

45	45		301							1	Rosetta	There was a minor hiccup, but we completed the mission successfully.	1																					
46	46		301								Diana	Huh? Is that...	2																					
47	47		301								Rosetta	You guessed it. We have a new addition to the Forest Guard.	1																					
48	48		301								Rosetta	Everyone, say hello to Frost Oath.	1																					
49	49		301								Diana	The marks on you two... Did you go to the mountain?	2																					
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301								Rosetta	We did.	1																					
52	52		301								Diana	...	2																					
53	53		301								Rosetta	Sorry for making you all worried.	1																					
54	54		301								Diana	Sigh. It's not like we can do anything about it now.	2																					
55	55		301								Diana	Let's go back to camp and get you fixed up.	2																					
56	56		301								Rosetta	...	1																					
57	57		301									Before the hesitant Rosetta can finish speaking, Frost Oath walks off toward the camp.																						
58	58		301								Rosetta	I'll leave it to you then.	1																					
59	59		301								Diana	Yeah, that's more like it.	2																					
60	60		401							2	1514																							
61	61		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Diana pats Rosetta on the shoulder. Then the Forest Guard follows Frost Oath to the camp.

64	64		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While undergoing maintenance, Rosetta looks at her comrades standing before her. Even though they have been through so much, they still stand dignified. She cannot help but smile.

66	66		301							1	Rosetta	I didn't realize how much everyone has grown.	1

69	69		301							1	Diana	You have, too. The old Rosetta wouldn't be so willing to accept help from others.	2																					
70	70		204							1	6																							
71	71		301								Rosetta	I'm sorry.	1																					
72	72		204							1																								
73	73		301								Diana	It's okay. We've been working hard to help shoulder your burden.	2																					
74	74		301								Rosetta	You've known all this time?	1																					
75	75		301								Diana	You wear your heart on your sleeve, Rosetta.	2																					
76	76		301								Diana	Members of the Forest Guard might not be strong individually, but as long as we come together, nothing can stand in our way.	2																					
77	77		301								Diana	This is how we survive.	2																					
78	78		301								Diana	It's not one person's responsibility to protect everyone. We work together and share this duty.	2																					
79	79		301								Rosetta	...You're right.	1																					
80	80		301								Rosetta	I did go overboard in the past.	1																					
81	81		301								Rosetta	But now, I hope you will all help me shape the future of the Forest Guard.	1
