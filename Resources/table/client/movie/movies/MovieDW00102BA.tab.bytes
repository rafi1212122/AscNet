18	17		301							1	Watanabe	Whoa... not bad...	1																					
19	18		301								Watanabe	But I'd advise you to stand back. If you got hurt, these Gray Raven fellas might just collapse.	1																					
20	19		201							1	500026																							
21	20		301							1	Lee	(112, 671), detecting a sizable Corrupted response. Risk of a breakthrough.	1																					
22	21		201							1	1101001																							
23	22		301							1	Watanabe	We're on it. Reinforcements have been sent to the breach.	1																					
24	23		202							1	2																							
25	24		301									Back to back, the two strike at the same time, and the encroaching Corrupted are knocked flying.

28	27		202							1																								
29	28		301			RImgBg1Shake						Nearby, Changyu's fist makes contact with a Corrupted chest. Contradictory to the boy's slender frame, the punch warps the Corrupted vessel beyond recognition as it sails towards Watanabe.																						
30	29		301									Lee and Watanabe quickly separate and finish off several enemies struck by the flying Corrupted chassis.																						
31	30		201							1	1101001																							
32	31		301							1	Watanabe	Akdelik runt... are you trying to get us killed?	1

42	41		202							1																								
43	42		301									Compared to the sufficiently extravagant Eternal Engine and the Nighter, the Forsaken HQ is spartan, almost bare.

45	44		301							1	Liv	Watanabe-San, what's in here?	1																					
46	45		202							1																								
47	46		301									Without a word, Watanabe opens the containers and instructs the Forsaken soldiers in the HQ to help move their contents.																						
48	47		201							1	500166	6																						
49	48		301							1	Lucia	Rice? And beans and seasoning... is that all there is? What do the Forsaken want with this food?	1																					
50	49		302								Go and ask	50	Leave it be	51																				
51	50	52	301								Lucia	You're curious too, Commandant? Then I shall go ask.	1																					
52	51		301								Lucia	Memory Data on the Forsaken indicates... feels... like they are not a threat... I'll go ask!	1																					
53	52		301								Lucia	Hello, may I ask what this food is for?	1

55	56		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Duanwu festival's almost here! We're makin' Zongs!	1

57	57		301							1	Lucia	Duanwu festival...? Do you know what that is, Commandant?	1																					
58	102		302								An old Eastern festival	120

60	103		301								Lucia	Festival... there appears to be an analog... in my Memory Data. It feels warm.	1

62	105		301							1	Changyu	We are pretty close to the Duanwu Festival... Do the Forsaken even observe it?	1																					
63	106		201							1	500172																							
64	58		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Several years ago, we saved someone by the ocean. He told us that he sold Zongs on the Nighter. He was heavily modified with cybernetics. Most of his organs weren't his anymore. It was a miracle that he survived being thrown into the sea.	1																					
65	59		301								Forsaken Soldier	Day and night, that man dreamt of returning home. So fierce was his longing that several of our companions starting feeling the same way, and we ended up taking him in. He was the one who told us about Duanwu, and taught us how to make Zongs.	1																					
66	107		201							1	500124	1																						
67	60		301							1	Changyu	The man who sold Zongs on the Nighter... was his name Old Man Fu? I knew him. I ate his Zongs too!	1																					
68	61		302								Where is he now?	108																						
69	108		201							1	500172																							
70	62		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Dunno. One day, he just up and disappeared. We never found him.	1																					
71	63		202							1																								
72	64		301									The soldier spots Watanabe approaching, throws a salute, then joins the line of men moving supplies.

74	121		401							1	211																							
75	66		301							1	Watanabe	Hmph, in a world devoid of hope, it is impossible to survive without something to miss.	1																					
76	67		301								Watanabe	It so happened that our could handle making these Zongs, and so Duanwu became the one festival we celebrate and pin our hopes on throughout the year.	1																					
77	68		301								Watanabe	This year, however, Corrupted activity has surged thanks to the presence of the Ascendant, and we've been unable to gather the requisite supplies.	1																					
78	69		201							1	500124																							
79	70		301							1	Changyu	Hence the trip to the Nighter?	1																					
80	71		201							1	500026																							
81	72		301							1	Lee	What is the significance of this festival, to warrant the allocation of so many resources?	1																					
82	73		201							1	1101001	1																						
83	74		301							1	Watanabe	Significant? There are those among us who consider it so significant, that they have named themselves "Zongs".	1																					
84	75		201							1	500124																							
85	76		301							1	Changyu	You're kidding, no one is as stupid as that.	1																					
86	77		301								Changyu	Really? Come on...	1																					
87	78		201							1	1101001																							
88	79		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Watanabe	For you, perhaps it is just a marginally more important day, but for us, Duanwu is the only release for a protracted and solitary longing. I don't want to disappoint them on a day like this.	1
