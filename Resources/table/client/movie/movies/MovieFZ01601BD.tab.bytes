20	20		301								Valeria	These are Commander Nikola's direct orders.																						
21	21		301								Asimov	It's not like he can kill me for refusing to comply. I don't meddle with what they do, but without me, they certainly can't accomplish their goals.	1																					
22	22		301								Asimov	Unlike you little beetles, I'm not a disposable pawn.	1																					
23	23		301								Valeria	...																						
24	24		301								Asimov	But, since I've said yes to your dirty work, you can expect it to be executed perfectly.	1																					
25	25		301								Asimov	And for this, I've already gotten what I needed to know from Nikola.	1																					
26	26		301								Yata	If that's the case, what's with the hard talk?																						
27	27		301								Asimov	Because, I dislike you curs.	1																					
28	28		301								Asimov	Commandants like the Gray Raven Commandant will be the key to recovering Earth, but you... will be nothing but blades rusting in blood.	1																					
29	29		301								Yata	Hey, V, you hear that? Someone's calling you a dog again.																						
30	30		301								Valeria	So?																						
31	31		301								Asimov	?	1																					
32	32		301								Valeria	Somebody's gotta play the dog, so others can play the human.																						
33	33		301								Valeria	Good people, bad peopleโthey all need dogs that don't ask questions.																						
34	34		301								Asimov	Which is why, I despise you.	1																					
35	35		301								Yata	Can we return to the mission? I'm about to lose my patience.																						
36	36		301								Yata	You helping us out or not? Chief, decide already. I suggest you do it quickly.																						
37	37		301								Asimov	...I'll give you the coordinates of the invader, but only if you tell me what your plans are.	1																					
38	38		301								Yata	We're monitoring. And to stop this fella from standing in our way.																						
39	39		301								Yata	We gave a warning at the memorial park. Let's hope this little rat takes a hint.																						
40	40		301								Asimov	...Monitoring who?	1																					
41	41		301								Valeria	That does not concern you.
