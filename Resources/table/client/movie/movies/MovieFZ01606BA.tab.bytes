6	23		301			DialogEnable						Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—a certain rumor has spread out among the scavengers.																						
7	24		201							1	500259																							
8	25		301							1	Young Scavenger	T-they say that there are p-plenty of resources in those abandoned ruins.	1																					
9	26		301								Young Scavenger	A-apparently some organization brought them there to rebuild the ruins.	1																					
10	27		301								Young Scavenger	B-but they were attacked, and the rebuilding plans were c-canceled, and the r-resources were left there.	1																					
11	28		301									If you were to ask the scavengers where this rumor came from, you would receive nothing but vague answers.																						
12	29		301								Young Scavenger	I-I dunno. I t-told you out of goodwill. If you don't wanna go, I'll g-go myself.	1																					
13	30		301									Or perhaps, you might receive an even worse answer.																						
14	31		201							1	500260																							
15	32		301							1	Scavenger Girl	A winged mechanic angel told me!	1

18	35		301							1	???	...	2																					
19	36		301								???	Princess Bella, should we trust this intel?	2																					
20	37		301								Bella	How many times do I have to tell you?! Just call me Bella! Don't use what you learned from your manga on me. They don't say it like that in those books anyway!	1																					
21	38		301								???	Perhaps you should read more books, Bella-chan.	2																					
22	39		301								Bella	Yikes... Give me a break.	1																					
23	40		301								Bella	It's hard to tell if it's true, but resources are depleted around here anyway, and we still have some food reserve, we might as well check it out.	1																					
24	41		301								???	Then I'll make the preparations. If we run into any danger, I'll protect you like a Cardman Rider, Bella-chun.	2																					
25	42		301								Bella	Pff! Slime, if you call me anything like that again, I'll rip all the books in your backpack.	1																					
26	43		301								Slime?	Whatever you say, you're doing what you hate the most yourself.	2																					
27	44		301								Shrek	My name is Shrek! Plus, that rotten chicken soup book in your hand should be ripped apart first!	2																					
28	45		301								Bella	This is faith! The harsher the environment, the more important it is to believe in hope.	1																					
29	46		301								Bella	As long as we have a strong heart, there's nothing we can't overcome!	1																					
30	47		301								Shrek	It's a placebo, Bella dear.	2																					
31	48		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		Hearing what he called her, Bella lets out a scream and wrestles with Shrek.																						
32	49		202							1	2				1																			
33	50		301									The scavengers nearby watch them enviously.																						
34	51		201							1	500259																							
35	52		301							1	Young Scavenger	How nice... They must have a full belly to be able to wrestle.	1																					
36	53		202							1					1																			
37	54		301									He is not wrong. Bella and Shrek are good fighters. Together they have taken over several mobster bases, plundered their food reserve, then made a killing by selling the loot.																						
38	55		301									If it were not for their obsession with books, they would probably have saved up more supplies and would not have to venture into the rumored ruins.																						
39	56		201							1	500003		400																					
40	57		201							2	500262		-400																					
41	58		301							1	Shrek	My book!	2																					
42	59		301									Shrek screeches painfully. A page of his precious book is torn.																						
43	60		301								Shrek	Damn it... I should've traded the supplies for a terminal instead! Synthetic paper is such a nuisance!	2																					
44	61		301								Bella	A terminal? Can you even afford using it?! We'd still have a ton of food left if it wasn't for the books!	1																					
45	62		301								Bella	...Anyway. Let's just go to the ruins. It'll be dinnertime soon if we keep dilly-dallying.	1																					
46	63		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Shrek mournfully holds the torn book in his arms and drags his feet behind Bella toward the ruins.

49	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After a tedious trek, the two finally arrive at the ruins, but what they see gives them goosebumps.

52	69		301							1	Bella	...What in the world is this?	1																					
53	70		301									Frail scavengers are crawling on the streets. A bright red fluid gushes out of the ground and swallows them quickly.																						
54	71		301								Shrek	It seems that even the planet is crying bloody tears.	2																					
55	72		301									Bella ignores Shrek's poetic comment. She grabs hold of a scavenger and waves a biscuit in front of him.

59	77		301							1	Bella	What's with that red stuff?	1																					
60	78		301								Scavenger	They say it's heaven.	3																					
61	79		301								Bella	Heaven?	1																					
62	80		301								Scavenger	I dunno. They say if you jump in, you'll have eternal life. You can even come out of it and talk.	3																					
63	81		301								Shrek	...Is that the river Styx?	2																					
64	82		301								Scavenger	I don't have many friends in there, so I've only seen other people's friends come out of it.	3																					
65	83		301									The pair exchanges a silent glance. The scavenger may be scrawny but it looks like he is telling the truth.																						
66	84		301								Scavenger	The recent new comers have all jumped in. I'm kind of timid, still debating what to do.	3																					
67	85		301								Scavenger	But everyone has been saying that since we're starving and miserable already, we might as well give this unknown heaven a try.	3																					
68	86		301								Scavenger	And you know what, everyone that jumped in said it was great when they came out.	3																					
69	90		301									The scavenger takes the biscuit from Bella and gives them a bow.																						
70	91		301								Scavenger	Thank you. There are a few ruffians around here. Try to stay away from them.	3

74	92		301								Bella	...	1																					
75	93		301								Shrek	Should we bring them to justice and replenish our supplies in the process?	2																					
76	94		301								Bella	Good idea, but we should figure out what they're capable of first.	1																					
77	95		301								Bella	Resources around our area are running low. We have to restock before we can travel further.	1																					
78	96		301								Shrek	I'll do as you wish, Bella love.	2																					
79	97		301									Maddened, Bella holds in her anger and opens the nostalgic Chicken Soup for the Soul magazine and begins to read through "Forgiveness is the Key". Shrek squats down in anguish as if he heard a banshee screech.																						
80	98		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bella	Alright. Let's roll.	1
