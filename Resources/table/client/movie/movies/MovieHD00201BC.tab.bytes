4	4		301							1	Asimov	It's rare to see you arriving earlier than me. I suppose you're looking forward to this operation.	1																					
5	5		302								That's right.	6	As long as it stops you from complaining.	7																				
6	6	10	301								Asimov	Very well.	1																					
7	7		301								Asimov	So you do realize you have a different perception of time...	1																					
8	8		302								That's an improvement.	9																						
9	9		301								Asimov	Anyway, let's get down to business.	1																					
10	10		301								Asimov	As you can see, Project Babel has entered the fifth phase.	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	I believe you're already well acquainted with this test. If you have any questions, go check the mission details.	1																					
12	12		301								Asimov	I haven't asked you before. You've already completed many tests. What do you feel about this project?	1																					
13	13		302								You can make it harder.	14	It's a little difficult.	16																				
14	14		301								Asimov	That confident, huh?	1																					
15	15	19	301								Asimov	I hope you'll be satisfied with the new strategic targets.	1																					
16	16		301								Asimov	Oh really.	1																					
17	17		301								Asimov	We've added new strategic targets this time. They allow you to adjust the combat intensity according to your own needs.	1																					
18	18		301								Asimov	However, a moderate level of stress will improve your concentration. I want the combat data to be as accurate as possible.	1																					
19	19		301								Asimov	The goal of Project Babel is to collect data from more intense battles. In addition to the Constructs' strength, you should pay attention to the team formation and your own leadership.	1																					
20	20		301								Asimov	You can say it's practically no different from the actual battlefield.	1																					
21	21		301								Asimov	In the previous tests, each team showed me the huge potentials of different battle tactics.	1																					
22	22		301								Asimov	We're now able to create more realistic simulated battle environments and strategic targets based on the operation data collected in the previous phases.	1																					
23	23		301								Asimov	It's the other reason why I implement Project Babel.	1																					
24	24		301								Asimov	You just need to show us your true power as usual.	1																					
25	25		301								Asimov	I'm looking forward to what your team can achieve this time...	1																					
26	26		302								Of course.	27																						
27	27		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Asimov	...And what combat data you can bring me.	1
