18	18		301							1	Lucia	Why did the red and blue factions stop fighting and combine forces to attack this new mechanoid?	3																					
19	19		301								Liv	Not to mention, this mechanoid doesn't appear to be hostile toward us.	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	Guess we'll have to look into it.	2																					
21	21		302								How do we do that?	22																						
22	22		301								Liv	Do you mean... hacking them?	1																					
23	23		301								Lee	Guess you're familiar with Kurono's tactics... But that won't be necessary for now.	2																					
24	24		301								Liv & Lucia	?	1	3																				
25	25		301									Lee snaps his fingers. The damaged mechanoid turns its trembling head as if it idenitifies the sound.																						
26	26		301								Damaged Mechanoid	...Yjkan89[v?																						
27	27		301								Lee	Looks like its language and hearing modules aren't "completely" destroyed.	2																					
28	28		301								Lee	In that case...	2																					
29	29		301									Lee makes a series of unidentifiable sounds.																						
30	30		302								What's this?	31	(Looks quietly)	32																				
31	31		301									Lee lifts his pointer finger as if gesturing you to be quiet.																						
32	32		301									As Lee finishes speaking, the trembling mechanoid lifts its head and looks at him.																						
33	33		301									The mechanoid's frame shakes as it spouts intermittent strings of nonsense from a voice module located somewhere inside it.

36	36		302								I think I heard another mechanoid say the same thing.	37																						
37	37		301								Lucia	The mechanoid shows no obvious signs of defects or design flaws.	3																					
38	38		301								Liv	You're right. Any malfunctions and damage were caused during the battle.	1																					
39	39		301								Lee	It said it was a defect unassigned to a "color," so it couldn't participate in the "war."	2

46	46		301								Lee	..."When one side wins, Father will be awakened. If there is no victory, everything will return to the 'Strip of Truth', and the cycle will start anew"?	2																					
47	47		301								Lucia	...I can't follow along with all the unknown terminologies.	3																					
48	48		301								Lee	We don't have enough intel. Let's keep note of it and see if we can uncover any more intel during our investigation to corroborate it.	2																					
49	49		301									The mechanoid turns to face Lucia as if wanting to say something. Instead, sparks burst out from its head as it begins to shake violently.																						
50	50		301									—At which point, the mechanoid's head droops to the side, lifeless.																						
51	51		301								Liv	...The damages are too severe. It's lost all functionality.	1																					
52	52		301								Lee	Judging from the trail of debris, I'm guessing it came from where the two factions were fighting just now.	2																					
53	53		301								Lee	Looks like it was trying to get here as it was attacked.	2																					
54	54		301								Liv	Why...	1																					
55	55		301								Lee	The only way to answer that question is to follow the trail back toward the red and blue mechanoids.	2																					
56	56		301								Lucia	Well then, let's continue our mission.	3																					
57	57		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Alright, let's move out.
