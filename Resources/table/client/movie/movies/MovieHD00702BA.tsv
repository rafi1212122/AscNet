5	5		302								How far have I traveled in this desert...	6																						
6	6		301									Your vehicle raises a fog of dust as it glides through the desert, and the sand dispersed in the air like a fleeting cloud.

12	12		302								I'm awake.	13	Keep an eye out?	13																				
13	13		301								Celica	I know we're working with the Forsaken for now, but you can never tell what sort of accidents could happen down there. Just be careful.	1																					
14	14		302								I will. Don't worry.	15																						
15	15		301								Celica	Good to hear that. After all, the Gray Ravens aren't by your side this time, and they're all worried sick...	1																					
16	16		302								Let them know I'm safe and sound, will you?	17																						
17	17		301								Celica	I will. Make sure to keep your comms open and keep tabs on the cruise control. You're about two kilometers from the meeting point. Safe travels!	1

29	29		301									The visible heatwave rises from the sand, distorting and refracting light, and you can see the dunes transforming into a pot of molten gold.																						
30	30		301									Your transport slowly enters the designated area. You can see the paved path ahead of you as your vehicle gradually stops bumping.																						
31	31		301									The Forsaken soldiers stop your ride under Watanabe's lead.																						
32	32		301									You have yet to enter the campsite proper, unlike what you were expecting. You can tell it is still quite a distance away just from the view on your ride.																						
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Uncertain about the current situation, you recall what Celica mentioned and prepare for any unforeseen arrangement.

37	37		302								Have you been waiting here?	38	The journey here took a while...	39																				
38	38	40	301								Watanabe	Consider this part of my "goodwill." I did promise to guarantee your safety.	1																					
39	39		301								Watanabe	Not surprising. It's a rough neighborhood.	1																					
40	40		301								Watanabe	Sorry for not informing you beforehand, but we'll need you to stop here.	1																					
41	41		301								Watanabe	For the sake of both of our sides, I can't allow a Babylonia vessel to enter our camp directly. It's an inconvenient time—you'll understand once you arrive.	1																					
42	42		301								Watanabe	But you don't have to worry. No harm will come to you. The Forsaken does not forget the people who fought by our side.	1																					
43	43		302								I understand.	44																						
44	44		301									Watanabe nods and gestures to the soldiers around him, and a senior-looking guard walks up with a detection device.

48	48		301									Your pistol, as well as your emergency fire starter kit, are both confiscated.																						
49	49		301								Guard Leader	My apologies. No fire-starting items are allowed in the camp, and... what is this?	2																					
50	50		302								A water bottle... obviously?	51																						
51	51		301								Guard Leader	Would you mind taking a sip in front of us now? If it's alcohol...	2																					
52	52		301								Watanabe	Enough, no need to be so thorough. Babylonia's not gonna allow a commandant to drink on the job, and this one doesn't seem like the rule-breaking kind.	1																					
53	53		301								Watanabe	Have you notified the folks in the camp?	1																					
54	54		301								Guard Leader	We did. Although we do recognize the Gray Raven Commandant, there have been many newcomers in the camp...	2																					
55	55		302								Newcomers?	56																						
56	56		202							1	2				1																			
57	57		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Watanabe does not answer you. He turns and signals everyone to follow him to the Forsaken base.

59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Unlike the calm and quiet campsite you remembered, the one you are seeing is bustling—																						
60	60		301									The military tents by the road have turned into various stalls, where the Forsaken members trade and exchange rare items and supplies.																						
61	61		301									More surprisingly, you notice a large group of children running by the Forsaken headquarter, giggling.

64	64		301							1	Guard Leader	Hey, kids! Stop running around in here! You're going to bring down the tent!	1

70	70		301							1	Watanabe	Don't be so surprised. This isn't our only camp, and we... are not the only ones forsaken.	1																					
71	71		301								Watanabe	We built a small shelter to the east of here after what happened with the ARU. The kids and the newcomers are staying there.	1																					
72	72		301								Watanabe	They should be the actual hope for the future... We couldn't abandon them.	1																					
73	73		302								That's why you were searching me so thoroughly...	74																						
74	74		202							1					1

76	76		201							1	500172

80	80		301							1	Watanabe	...Supplier. A supplier for now.	2																					
81	81		301								Zong	I see! You might want to take this... "supplier" elsewhere first?	1																					
82	82		301								Zong	And don't forget to answer your comms, Mr. Watanabe. You're about to be late for the call with the blue gentleman.	1																					
83	83		301								Watanabe	You don't have to remind me. I'll reply after this—and we aren't the ones who are late, to begin with.	2																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		301									The children who entered the campsite earlier are still hanging around. They shoot a glance at your side every once in a while, and Watanabe waves back with a warm, friendly smile, unlike his usual solemn self.																						
86	86		301									But when he turns back at you, he looks exactly as he was.																						
87	87		201							1	1101001																							
88	88		301							1	Watanabe	Cough... 【kuroname】, let's talk business.	1																					
89	89		301								Watanabe	I've only received a very vague report about this test. But before that... there's something else that I'm more curious about.	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301									At Watanabe's cue, the Forsaken soldiers open the marked cache.																						
92	92		301									The CUB for this testing immediately activates and hovers by Watanabe's side.																						
93	93		301									Right now, it is just a polygon with red stripes on one side, looking quite ordinary.																						
94	94		201							1	1101001																							
95	95		301							1	Watanabe	This thing can... help in a fight? It looks so...	1																					
96	96		202							1					1																			
97	97		301									Watanabe activates its second stage with uncertainty.																						
98	98		301									Its form expands and changes as it transforms to prepare for engagements. The animalistic features and coatings of the machine immediately catch the people's attention... and catch them off guard.																						
99	99		301									Watanabe's doubtful gaze and the unexpected reveal have everyone on the scene turn silent.																						
100	100		201							1	1101001																							
101	101		301							1	Watanabe	I understand it's supposed to be a support unit, but isn't this design a little bit... excessive?	1																					
102	102		302								...	103	There were... thoughts put into it.	104																				
103	103	105	301								Watanabe	I assume there were specific... thoughts put into it?	1																					
104	104		301								Watanabe	If you say so... I suppose there's no harm in it.	1																					
105	105		301								Watanabe	If we're just talking about combat capabilities, it's indeed... quite...	1																					
106	106		301									Watanabe frowns, excruciating, desperately trying to convince himself with his own argument.

112	112		301							1	Celica	Is this a good time? Mind if I cut in?	1																					
113	113		301									The silence is broken up by a call from Babylonia. As the comms connect, Watanabe reverts to his typical expression.																						
114	114		301								Celica	I know the commandant isn't exactly on time, but our tracking shows that 【kuroname】 has arrived. And it seems that Mr. Watanabe here has a lot to say about our CUB?	1																					
115	115		301								Celica	But we can table that for later—it's one of our proudest creations, after all. Asimov, it's your turn to do the talking.	1																					
116	116		201							1	500004																							
117	117		301							1	Asimov	...I don't have much to say, to be honest.	1																					
118	118		301									The Chief Technician is apparently unfamiliar with an occasion like this, or maybe he simply does not care. He pays no attention to how restless he looks.																						
119	119		301								Asimov	Please check the instructions we sent you to see how to use and connect with the "Combat Unit Booster". It's just a prototype, so the user experience may not be perfect, but it won't be lethal.	1																					
120	120		301								Asimov	It might just get a little uncomfortable during the connection. But that's what you get from connecting to the M.I.N.D., so just prepare yourselves.	1																					
121	121		301								Asimov	Regarding its appearance, we have commissioned experts from the WGAA to design it, so I swear it's more than competent. Don't worry.	1																					
122	122		302								Is that true...	123	I guess looks can be deceiving.	123																				
123	123		301								Asimov	In that case, I'll count on the old models—I mean, the role models of the Forsaken to carry out this test.	1																					
124	124		203							1	0.25	400																						
125	125		201							2	1101001		-400																					
126	126		301							1	Watanabe	This is just standard fare. It's nothing to us.	2																					
127	127		301								Asimov	I can tell how battle-tested you all must be from the way you've been maintaining yourselves. I simply require data from older frames.	1																					
128	128		301								Watanabe	...It seems that Babylonia hasn't forgotten where this frame comes from.	2																					
129	129		301								Asimov	That... is not for me to say. Do you want me to fetch Hassen for you?	1																					
130	130		301								Watanabe	That won't be necessary.	2																					
131	131		301								Asimov	No offense, but it's probably best that we keep this kind of collaboration a one-time event. Good luck.	1

133	133		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
134	134		301									And the call ends there.																						
135	135		201							1	500005		400																					
136	136		301							1	Patrol Leader	Sir, is our... "supplier" clear?	1																					
137	137		204							2	1																							
138	138		301								Watanabe	Don't worry. They would have sent someone else if it was a trap.	2																					
139	139		301									Facing his hesitant crew, Watanabe casually gives him a pat on the shoulder.																						
140	140		301								Watanabe	For my part, I trust 【kuroname】. We have to have more friends who've fought with us than enemies against us, right?	2																					
141	141		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	But you, dear supplier, I do have a job for you before my men are done calibrating the machine.	2
