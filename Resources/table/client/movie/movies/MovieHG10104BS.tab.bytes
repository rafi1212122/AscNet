5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	You've been staring at me long enough. If you have something to say, just spit it out.	1																					
6	6		302								Look at you, Mr. Popular!	7	Is this the "unnecessary trouble" you were referring to?	7																				
7	7		301								Lee	...	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	I ran into the same thing on a previous mission.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	This Inver-Device isn't the usual "horn" shape, so people mistake me for a human.	1																					
10	10		302								Why not say that you're a Construct?	11	Do you think people care if you're a Construct?	12																				
11	11	14	301								Lee	As I said, Constructs can only leave when we're on a mission. That's why you need an application. I don't want to cause a scene or give us any trouble.	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	Constructs are combat androids created by humans. Humans have set reasonable "rules," therefore we abide by them. Much like how mathematics adheres to causality.	1																					
13	13		301								Lee	If I had time to concern myself with such trivial matters, I'd be better off using this time to upgrade my weapons.	1																					
14	14		302								I'm sure she just made a simple mistake.	15	Are you okay with me being the only human you talk to?	16																				
15	15	17	301								Lee	Do you want to go explain it to her or something?	1																					
16	16		301								Lee	Compared to stopping the Punishing Virus, this shouldn't cause any problems.	1																					
17	17		301								ã€kuronameã€‘	But this feels different from our usual work. Walking around Babylonia in street clothes, fells like...																						
18	18		302								A date...	19	A special occasion!	19

21	21		301								ã€kuronameã€‘	I don't know if you've noticed, but your M.I.N.D. becomes unstable whenever you go quiet... And your ears are turning red.																						
22	22		301								Lee	You've stayed connected this whole time?!	1																					
23	23		302								No! It was just a joke!	24	Are you shy, Lee?	25																				
24	24	26	301								ã€kuronameã€‘	Honestly, though. Your ears really are turning red.																						
25	25		301								Lee	Quit joking around!	1																					
26	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	I think there's just a glitch in my heat regulator. I'll troubleshoot it and fix it later.	1
