15	15	17	301								Lee	Bring it over first.	2																					
16	16		301								Lee	Videos of sermons, probably. This kind of device is pretty common before the outbreak, according to our database.	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	Huh... This wasn't shattered into two. It was designed to work only when the two parts come together.	2
