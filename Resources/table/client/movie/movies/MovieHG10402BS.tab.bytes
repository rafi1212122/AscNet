3	3		301			DialogEnable					Host	Up next is our main event!																						
4	4		301								Host	One-day romance!																						
5	5		301									The ballroom is instantly filled with clapping and cheering.																						
6	6		301								Host	Are you still exhausted from overworking? Are you still worried that you're too busy to find a date?																						
7	7		301								Host	Today's gala is going to pair up our commandants with a date for a one-day romance! Don't give up your shot!																						
8	8		302								Sounds interesting.		Why would they do something like that?																					
9	9		201							1	500128																							
10	10		301							1	Bianca	One-day romance?	1																					
11	11		301								Bianca	(Contemplates) So that's what the commandants do at their gatherings...	1																					
12	12		302								Don't overthink this, Bianca.	13	This is the first time I've seen it!	13																				
13	13		301								Bianca	I do understand why. After all, humans have this insatiable need to socialize, unlike us Constructs.	1																					
14	14		301								Bianca	I used to enjoy having companions as well, once.	1																					
15	15		302								You still can.	16	Is that so... I can't imagine what that Bianca was like.	16																				
16	16		301								Bianca	That's not how a Purifying Force member should act, though.	1																					
17	17		301								Bianca	I'm not like you... Commandant.	1																					
18	18		301								Bianca	Your squad is... more... "human."	1																					
19	19		301								Bianca	Despite its many drawbacks and mistakes, sometimes I do envy the fact that it has made you such a respected leader.	1																					
20	20		302								I envy you as well, Bianca.	21	You're making me blush.	30																				
21	21		301								Bianca	Envy me?	1																					
22	22		302								Your intellect, your decisiveness, and your strength.	23																						
23	23		301								Bianca	That's just what a captain should be.	1																					
24	24		302								Then I'm also just being what a commandant should be.	25																						
25	25		301								Bianca	...	1																					
26	26		302								You should be proud of yourself sometimes, Bianca.	27																						
27	27		301								Bianca	...	1																					
28	28		302								I'm proud of you, that I'm sure.	29																						
29	29	31	301								Bianca	...	1																					
30	30		301								Bianca	I'm just being honest.	1																					
31	31		202							1					1																			
32	32		301								Commandant A	Hey, it's your turn.																						
33	33		302								Huh?	34	What is it?	34																				
34	34		301								Commandant A	The lucky draw! Weren't you listening to the host?																						
35	35		302								Not at all...	36	Draw first and ask questions later, I guess!	36																				
36	36		201							1	500128																							
37	37		301							1	Bianca	...Me as well?	1																					
38	38		302								Sure, let's do it together!	39	There are gifts!	39																				
39	39		301								Bianca	That's outside my mission perimeter. I shouldn't be distracted.	1																					
40	40		302								Come on!	41	Isn't protecting me part of your job?	41																				
41	41		301								Bianca	A lucky draw has no direct impact on your safety.	1																					
42	42		302								It does, actually.	43	Of course it does!	43																				
43	43		301								Bianca	...How?	1																					
44	44		302								My feelings could get hurt.	45	My mood could get threatened.	45																				
45	45		301								Bianca	Commandant...	1																					
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301									Unfamiliar with this kind of conversation, Bianca is stunted, her eyes widened, speechless.																						
48	48		201							1	500128																							
49	49		301							1	Bianca	...Fine.	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									After a brief moment of hesitation, Bianca decides to follow suit. She adjusts her hair before reaching into the raffle box in pink.																						
52	52		201							1	500128																							
53	53		301							1	Bianca	I'll take this one.	1																					
54	54		302								I got "18."	59	Bianca is the best!	55																				
55	55		301								Bianca	...	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Holding her card solemnly, Bianca looks away and reads the number on her card.																						
58	58		201							1	500128																							
59	59		301							1	Bianca	Mine says "25."	1																					
60	60		202							1					1																			
61	61		301								Host	Alrighty then! Now that all the commandants have a card in their hands, I'll be announcing the lucky ones among you. Applause!																						
62	62		301									Thus the men and women there applaud and cheer, the sound echoing and shaking the room.																						
63	63		301									Bianca, a first-time participant, still acts calm and composed, but the slight redness on her ears reveals how she really feels.																						
64	64		301								Host	So—our first lucky participant—																						
65	65		301								Host	Number 3!																						
66	66		301									A petite, short-haired female commandant jumps in the crowd, waving at the host excitedly.																						
67	67		301								Host	Who is the lucky one that matches with this lovely commandant here?																						
68	68		301								Host	—Number 12!																						
69	69		301									As the host announces the number, a commandant in a hat is pushed to the front by his laughing peers on the other side of the room.																						
70	70		301								Host	Congratulations, commandants! Please approach backstage to register!																						
71	100		401							1	205																							
72	71		301								Host	All your expenses during your one-day romance are on us, so enjoy your date! I can't wait to see the sparks between them!																						
73	72		302								One-day romance...?	73	Isn't this just a normal lucky draw?!	73																				
74	73		201							1	500128																							
75	74		301							1	Bianca	Commandant...	1																					
76	75		202							1					1																			
77	76		301								Host	Now, our second pair!																						
78	77		301								Host	It is—our dearest—																						
79	78		201							1	500128																							
80	79		301							1	Bianca	Are we...	1																					
81	80		202							1					1																			
82	81		301								Host	Number 18!																						
83	82		302								What are the chances...	83	Me?!	83																				
84	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Host	And our dearest—Number 25! Congratulations!
