13	13		301							1	Nanami	Oh, Commandant, you're here! Morning!	1																					
14	14		302								Good morning.	16	What are you doing?	15																				
15	15		301								Nanami	Hehe, Nanami's sure you've already noticed!	1																					
16	16		301								Nanami	Commandant-commandant-listen-to-this!	1																					
17	17		301								Nanami	This is the new and improved Nanamiâ€”Pulse!	1																					
18	18		302								Did you get stronger?	19	Why is it called Pulse?	20																				
19	19	21	301								Nanami	Hm, I didn't get much stronger, but these booster wheels allow Nanami to zoom through the battlefield!	1																					
20	20		301								Nanami	Hm... When Nanami was looking through the dictionary and saw this word, Nanami felt itâ€”the feeling of "I chose you!" And look, Commandant! There are booster wheels!	1																					
21	21		301								Nanami	Although the defense didn't increase much, with these hot new booster wheels, Nanami can dish out all-new moves!	1																					
22	22		301								Nanami	I can do what manga characters do if I turn the speed up to max!	1																					
23	23		301								Nanami	"You thought you hit Nanami-sama? Too bad! It was only Nanami's after-image!"	1																					
24	24		302								That doesn't sound practical.	25	That's so cool!	26																				
25	25	27	301								Nanami	Hm... But Nanami likes this new frame.	1																					
26	26		301								Nanami	Nanami knew Commandant would like it!	1																					
27	27		301								Nanami	Anyway, since Nanami finally has a new frame, remember to bring Nanami along on the next mission, Commandant!	1																					
28	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	More people need to see this new Nanami, hehe.	1
