8	8		302								I'm just used to having him around.	12	It just feels a little empty here.	9																				
9	9		301								Lucia	Let me check the parts in our storage. Maybe Kamui will come back for his maintenance in the future.	2

20	20		302								See, Lee? You care!	21																						
21	21		301								Lee	I'm just doing this so that when the fool arrives, we can lock him inside the chamber immediately and shut him up.	1
