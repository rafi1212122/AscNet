7	7		301							1	Karenina	Why? Didn't we take care of the new variant? Are the Gray Ravens alright?	2																					
8	8		301								Bianca	Only because the commandant acted accordingly and the Gray Ravens have enough experience under their belt.	1																					
9	9		301								Bianca	If it was someone else...	1																					
10	10		301								Karenina	Since when did you like hearing yourself talk so much, Bianca?	2																					
11	11		301								Karenina	Just the person I need. Ask the commandant yourself. Didn't headquarters approve of our results last mission?	2																					
12	12		302								I can't say I approve of it either.	13	Regardless, the same can't be done next time.	13

17	17		301								Karenina	Same for Lucia, you, and the commandant...	2																					
18	18		301								Karenina	I did what I had to complete the mission. Now I'm taking all the blame even though it was a success.	2

21	21		301							1	Bianca	That's because what you did was too dangerous. We can use all sorts of other methods to track down the new variant.	1																					
22	22		301								Bianca	Not just throw yourself into harm's way.	1																					
23	23		301								Karenina	Enough already! I don't want to talk about this anymore.	2
