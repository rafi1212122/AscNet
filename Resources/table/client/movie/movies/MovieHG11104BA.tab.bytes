4	4		301									At the forward operating base, everyone is preparing for the upcoming mission.

8	8		302								What is it?	9																						
9	9		301								Sophia	I have something... I wanted to ask you.	1																					
10	10		302								What is it?	11																						
11	11		301								Sophia	...Alright.	1																					
12	12		301								Sophia	...	1																					
13	13		302								Didn't you want to ask me something?	14																						
14	14		301								Sophia	...Yeah.	1																					
15	15		301								Sophia	It's about your tactics.	1																					
16	16		302								...?	17																						
17	17		301								Sophia	During our last mission, you called the entire squad to help me when I got surrounded.	1																					
18	18		301								Sophia	Why?	1																					
19	19		301								Sophia	If you keep implementing this tactic, that poses a lot of risk over time.	1																					
20	20		301								Sophia	Especially for you and the other members... This may put the team in a dangerous situation that they shouldn't be in otherwise.	1																					
21	21		301								Sophia	It doesn't follow in line with maximizing interests, nor does it guarantee that the mission will be a success.	1

25	25		301								Sophia	?	1																					
26	26		301								Liv	We were just... discussing your situation. I wanted to have a chat with the commandant.	2

29	29		301							1	Lee	Since you're here, we can discuss it together.	1

32	32		301							1	Sophia	Did I do something wrong?	1																					
33	33		301								Liv	No... That's not it...	2																					
34	34		301								Liv	How should I put it...	2

37	37		301							1	Lee	Let me do it, Liv.	1																					
38	38		301								Lee	We need to make some things clear.	1																					
39	39		301								Lee	Sophia, stay in formation as much as possible from now on.	1																					
40	40		301								Lee	Or else Liv and I can't provide support, and our connection with the commandant will weaken.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500127																							
42	42		301							1	Sophia	If you can't keep up, then just leave me behind.	1																					
43	43		301								Sophia	I'm used to going at it alone in Asslam. Don't worry about me.	1																					
44	44		201							1	1031001																							
45	45		301							1	Liv	How is that okay?! If you get surrounded again...	1																					
46	46		201							1	500127																							
47	47		301							1	Sophia	Why?	1																					
48	48		301								Sophia	I can handle myself.	1																					
49	49		301								Sophia	And If I can't... No one should get hurt because of me.	1																					
50	50		302								No.	51																						
51	51		301								Sophia	...?	1																					
52	52		301								Sophia	But...	1																					
53	53		201							1	1021001	4																						
54	54		301							1	Lucia	Sophia, I don't know what your mindset was whenever you went into battle...	1																					
55	55		301								Lucia	But for us Gray Ravens, we don't have the concept of being "expendable" or "sacrificial."	1																					
56	56		204							1																								
57	57		301								Lucia	We hope the same goes for you, too.	1																					
58	58		302								Agreed.	59

60	60		301							1	Sophia	...	1																					
61	61		302								Every one of you...	62																						
62	62		301								Sophia	...	1																					
63	63		302								...Is important.	64																						
64	64		301								Sophia	I don't understand. Jamilah said, "Rational sacrifice is also a means to victory."	1																					
65	65		302								If that day comes...	66																						
66	66		302								I will make the call.	67																						
67	67		301								Sophia	But...!	1																					
68	68		302								But until that day comes...	69																						
69	69		302								I want you all here.	70																						
70	70		301								Sophia	...My mistake. I shouldn't make decisions on behalf of the commandant.	1																					
71	71		301								Sophia	I'm sorry.	1																					
72	72		202							1																								
73	73		301									Sophia turns and leaves with a blank expression on her face.

75	75		301							1	Lucia	Sophia!	1																					
76	76		302								Give her some time to think it over.	77																						
77	77		301								Lucia	Commandant?	1																					
78	78		302								As for the question I don't know the answer to...	79																						
79	79		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				...I'll find out the answer by myself.
