4	4		301							1	Rosetta	There's a lot I want to tell you about surviving out here on the snowfields, but today it'll have to wait...	1																					
5	5		302								I'm guessing you like surviving out here?	6	Anything else we should be doing?	7																				
6	6	8	301								Rosetta	Yeah. I like survival, since luck isn't as much of a factor. Card games, though, I like them for their gameplay.	1																					
7	7		301								Rosetta	Yeah, environmental surveying. This mission requires us to go conduct fieldwork.	1																					
8	8		301								Rosetta	Anyways, engineering wants us to set up our equipment on the designated coordinates.	1																					
9	9		302								What's all this equipment?	10	What else?	11																				
10	10	12	301								Rosetta	They're for surveying... I don't quite understand the technical details. They just need us to help set them up.	1																					
11	11		301								Rosetta	They'll handle the rest remotely. We just need to help with installing them.	1																					
12	12		301									The equipment Rosetta brought resembles various tripods with a camera terminal on top. It appears to also have basic AI functionality.																						
13	13		301								Rosetta	Stretch it out and put it somewhere stable on the snow. Then the AI will latch this device to the ground.	1																					
14	14		301								Rosetta	The engineers want at least some data soon. So, we need to set everything up before sundownâ€”Oh, huh...?	1																					
15	15		302								What's the matter?	16																						
16	16		301								Rosetta	It's gone...	1																					
17	17		204							1	8																							
18	18		301								Rosetta	The activation module... It's gone.	1																					
19	19		204							1	4																							
20	20		301								Rosetta	Looks like I lost it, but where could it have gone? Did I lose it on the plane... or on the way here?	1																					
21	21		301								Rosetta	I equipment-checked with the engineering staff through a checklist. I highly doubt that we've forgotten to bring it over... We must've lost it on the way here.	1																					
22	22		301								Rosetta	But that covers too wide of an area. We'll have to spend an hour or two just searching...	1																					
23	23		302								Better get started then...	24	Can you have someone send another over?	25																				
24	24	26	301								Rosetta	Yeah... You're right, Commandant. No choice.	1																					
25	25		301								Rosetta	I'll have to write some reports for Babylonia... But this is the safest bet.	1																					
26	26		301								Rosetta	I thought we could complete this mission without a hitch, but I guess today's not my lucky day...	1																					
27	27		202							1																								
28	28		401							2	1514																							
29	29		301									With that, Rosetta sighs. She picks up a pebble on the ground and tosses it into the ocean.																						
30	30		301									The pebble skips on the waterâ€”once, twice... all the way up to seven times, before plunging into the sea.																						
31	31		301									Rosetta notices your gaze and blushes before returning to her normal self.																						
32	32		201							1	500214																							
33	33		301							1	Rosetta	Some Forest Guards do this to forget about bad things... I figured I'd give it a shot.	1																					
34	34		301								Rosetta	Anyway, let's get moving...	1																					
35	35		301								???	Rotten figgins... Who's throwing rocks into the water?!																						
36	36		301								Rosetta	Huh?	1																					
37	37		202							1																								
38	100		401							1	102																							
39	38		301									Massive streams of bubbles fizzle near the shore, eventually breaking into a splash, revealing the silhouette of a massive, red-eyed figure.																						
40	39		201							1	500208																							
41	40		302								...An enemy?	41	No! Not the yeti!	42																				
42	41	43	301								Bionic Bear	So, you chucked that rock, aye?! Alright, have at it then, I'm gonna crush you!	1																					
43	42		301								Bionic Bear	Yeti your bear butt! I'm a bear, jellyface! Bionic bear, aye?!	1																					
44	43		201							1	500214																							
45	44		301							1	Rosetta	Wait... Why would there be a bionic bear in the ocean?	1																					
46	45		201							1	500208																							
47	101		401							1	205																							
48	46		301							1	Bionic Bear	Well, yeah? Cuz' I was swimming, aye?! What's the deal with you throwing rocks into the sea?! Summoning some watery tart for a golden rock?	1																					
49	47		302								She was just blowing off steam.	48	It wasn't intentional.	48																				
50	48		201							1	500214																							
51	49		301							1	Rosetta	I'm sorry.	1																					
52	50		201							1	500208																							
53	51		301							1	Bionic Bear	Oh...	1																					
54	52		301									Rosetta's simple and direct apology catches the bear off-guard. He visibly deflates, the rage nowhere to be seen. He asks you what it was all about.																						
55	53		301								Bionic Bear	Ah, alright. So you lost some module thingamajig?	1																					
56	54		201							1	500214	14																						
57	55		301							1	Rosetta	Yeah, so I was just skipping rocks to take my mind off it. I didn't think it'd hit you. I'm sorry.	1																					
58	56		201							1	500208																							
59	57		301								Bionic Bear	Oh, um, well, 's alright, I'll let it slide. Can't blame no bear for gettin' mad when you get a rock to the head outta nowhere, though. Sorry 'bout that.	1																					
60	58		301								Bionic Bear	So yeah, anyhow. You trying to turn them three-legs on?	1																					
61	59		302								Think you can help?	60	Have you seen our lost module?	61																				
62	60	62	301								Bionic Bear	Ya, I can help, alright.	1																					
63	61		301								Bionic Bear	Nope. But I can help you get it set up.	1																					
64	62		201							1	500214																							
65	63		301							1	Rosetta	...How?	1																					
66	64		201							1	500208																							
67	65		301							1	Bionic Bear	Just plug me right in, aye? I can turn 'em on. There's a control terminal on me back as well.	1																					
68	66		201							1	500214																							
69	67		301							1	Rosetta	I never knew bionic bears could do this...	1																					
70	68		201							1	500208																							
71	69		301							1	Bionic Bear	Yeah, yeahâ€”bionics can do a lot more than you Constructs... What's that human's name?	1																					
72	70		302								(Tell the bear your name)	71	I'm a Construct, too.	72																				
73	71	73	301								Bionic Bear	ã€kuronameã€‘, aye? Alright, just do what I say.	1																					
74	72		301								Bionic Bear	If you're the punchline, I give that a two outta ten... Just grab the cable and plug it to my back!	1																					
75	73		202							1																								
76	74		401							2	1515																							
77	75		301									â€”â€”																						
78	76		301									With the help of the bear, you successfully activate the equipment, and Rosetta sighs in relief.																						
79	77		201							1	500208																							
80	78		301							1	Bionic Bear	Hah, cake. Done and done.	1																					
81	79		302								Thanks.	80																						
82	80		301								Bionic Bear	Them folks' been talking about helping you humans outâ€”figured I'd lend a paw. But don't go redistributin' sedimentary wealth into the sea again, Forest Guard!	1																					
83	81		201							1	500214																							
84	82		301							1	Rosetta	I'll try my best not to.	1																					
85	83		201							1	500208																							
86	84		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Bionic Bear	You'll TRY?!	1
