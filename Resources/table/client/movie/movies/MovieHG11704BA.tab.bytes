6	5		301									The girl in white turns and looks over. Her expression is one of mystery.																						
7	6		301									Under the glow of the amber light, the girl is illuminated in a half-shade. The wind blows stronger as the two of you rise, higher and higher.																						
8	7		301									The odd and fantastic Ferris Wheel only serves to add to the surreal air of the event.																						
9	8		301									Luna is opposite to you, her two massive bundles of white hair fluttering in the wind. A few tufts of hair flicker by her eyes, and only then did you realize that, even her eyelashes are pure white.																						
10	9		301									Beneath those lashes, you find her light golden pupils. Not a ripple of emotion nor disturbance can be seen, but they do emit a certain warmth. It reminds you of a dew-touched morning in late spring, calm and unbroken.																						
11	10		302								(Kinda makes me wanna chuckle.)	11	Heh.	11																				
12	11		201							1	500238																							
13	12		301							1	Luna	What are you laughing at?	1																					
14	13		302								Just how sudden all this is.	14																						
15	14		301								Luna	How sudden this is?	1																					
16	15		302								Like what's happening now.	16																						
17	16		302								It's like those games that Kamui plays...	17																						
18	17		301								Luna	I don't get it.	1																					
19	18		302								This Ferris Wheel...	19																						
20	19		301								Luna	...?	1																					
21	20		301									Luna really does not seem to get it.																						
22	21		302								Ferris Wheels don't look like this.	22	You're riding a roundabout.	22																				
23	22		302								Ferris Wheels and roundabouts are different.																							
24	23		301								Luna	Is that so...?	1																					
25	24		301									A light shade of redness seems to have surfaced on Luna's face.																						
26	25		302								...	26																						
27	26		301									All of a sudden, the atmosphere takes an awkward turn.																						
28	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	I've never been on a Ferris Wheel before... I don't know about the details.	1

33	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Luna	A long time ago... I once hid in a theme park with my sister.	1																					
34	33		301								Luna	I wanted to try the rides in the theme park, so she did everything she could to power up the facilities.	1																					
35	34		301								Luna	But before we could try them, the sounds attracted a horde of Corrupted over.	1																					
36	35		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	And so I never quite knew... what a Ferris Wheel is like.	1

41	38		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					But this is pretty nice, too!	39	It's a first for me too on such a special one.	39																				
42	39		302								If I never came to this place...	40																						
43	40		302								I would never have gone on such a special ride.	42																						
44	42		301			DialogEnable					Luna	...	1																					
45	43		301								Luna	You must be one of those types that can get a laugh out of anything.	1																					
46	44		302								That depends on the thing.	45	Life, lemonades. All in the mind.	45																				
47	45		301								Luna	If you didn't stop me just now, I could have destroyed all those mechanoids. They aren't built for combat.	1																					
48	46		302								Well, we got rid of them now.	47	This theme park is pretty nice. Let them be.	47																				
49	47		301								Luna	...Why are you doing this?	1																					
50	48		301									â€”Because when you wake up, you won't remember anything that happened deep in your M.I.N.D.																						
51	49		301								Luna	Why are you helping me?	1																					
52	50		301									â€”Because I can't get out unless you're also safe... Probably?																						
53	998		204							1	5																							
54	51		301								Luna	...Tell me what you want.	1																					
55	52		302								Do you know what's the Tyndall effect?	53																						
56	53		301								Luna	...Of course.	1																					
57	54		301								Luna	When light passes through something with suspended particles, it becomes visible.	1																					
58	55		302								Which means, even when we're lost, there's a way.	997																						
59	997		204							1	4																							
60	56		301								Luna	What are you trying to say?	1																					
61	57		302								Maybe you're the Tyndall light in this dream.	996																						
62	996		204							1	5																							
63	58		301								Luna	What if it doesn't work?	1																					
64	59		302								We'll find another way.	995	As long as we live, help will come.	995																				
65	995		204							1	3																							
66	60		301								Luna	Where does your confidence even come from?	1																					
67	994		204							1	5																							
68	61		301								Luna	You're not just believing in me blindly, but others too?	1																					
69	62		302								Just leave this to me.	63	It's kinda my job to be always confident.	63																				
70	63		301								Luna	...	1																					
71	64		302								Oh, right. This is for you.	65																						
72	65		301								Luna	What's that?	1																					
73	66		201							1	500266																							
74	67		301							1		You take out the gift, now devoid of its wrappings. It reveals itself to be a... small night light.	1																					
75	68		201							1	500238																							
76	69		301							1	Luna	A lamp...?	1																					
77	70		302								A'Mao gave me this by the entrance.	71																						
78	71		301								Luna	This is the first time I've received a gift from someone other than my sister.	1																					
79	72		302								I just didn't want to waste it.	73	I feel like you'll like it.	73																				
80	73		301									Luna hesitates, but eventually extends her hands. You presenting her with a gift seems to have taken her by surprise.

82	75		301									As Luna's fingertips are about to reach the lamp, the world falls apart again.
