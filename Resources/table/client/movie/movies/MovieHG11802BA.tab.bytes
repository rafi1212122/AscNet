3	3		301			DialogEnable						You are not in the training room but in a much older shooting range this time, a quieter space with fewer visitors. You hold an actual rifle in your hands, which feels quite different from the one in the simulation.																						
4	4		301									You aim at the distant target and take a deep breath. There is no wind, no interference from the environment, and your training focuses on the fundamental skill of precision.																						
5	5		301									Thinking about the lessons from the training course, you toggle the safety.																						
6	6		401							2	1510																							
7	7		301									Following the sound of a "Bang!", the system announces the points of the ring you hit in your headset.																						
8	8		301								System	Round 10, 3rd shot, result: 7.6. Please keep up.																						
9	9		301									The right hand is still slightly numb.																						
10	10		301									Inhale. Exhale. You place your sight back through the scope...																						
11	11		301								???	Better to steady your rifle first.																						
12	12		302								?	13	Who's there?	13																				
13	13		301								???	Don't get distracted. The moment you hold a gun, there is only the target.																						
14	14		302								...	15																						
15	15		301								???	Every time you aim your gun... you have... to hit... Yawn.																						
16	16		301									With the voice's guidance, you once again focus on your target for now.																						
17	17		301									The voice pauses for a moment after a lengthy yawn. Like a machine that has finally booted up, his voice becomes calm and steady when he speaks again.																						
18	18		301								???	Sniper rifles are different from the tactical pistols you're familiar with.																						
19	19		301								???	Precision shooting tests your entire shooting system, not just the singular aspect of "aiming."																						
20	20		301								???	Aiming is actually the estimation of the projectile's trajectory in the air. Any changes in your shooting system during this process will affect the result, causing the actual impact point to deviate from the prediction.																						
21	21		301								???	You're too focused on "aiming."																						
22	22		302								Too focused?	23																						
23	23		301								???	Breaths and pulses affect how stable your posture is, while observation and thinking will create unwanted human errors. These are the weak links of your shooting system.																						
24	24		301								???	So, the more human errors are reduced, the more often you can perform excellent shooting.																						
25	25		301								???	...And you're being too restless. Calm and steady.																						
26	26		302								...	27	(Take a deep breath)	27																				
27	27		301								???	Keep your scope aligned above the barrel.																						
28	28		301								???	The moment you think you're ready... don't hesitate.																						
29	29		302								(Fire)	30																						
30	30		401							2	1510																							
31	31		301								System	Round 10, 4th shot, result: 8.6. Please keep up.																						
32	32		302								Phew.	33																						
33	33		401							1	204																							
34	34		301									After putting down the rifle, you turn around and find Wanshi on a lounge chair not far away, having no idea how long he has been there.																						
35	35		302								Thanks.	36																						
36	36		201							1	500273																							
37	37		301							1	Wanshi	Hmm... It's just that you training here is disrrupting my sleep.	1																					
38	38		302								I didn't know you were here.	39	But this is the training room.	40																				
39	39	42	301								Wanshi	True... well...	1																					
40	40		301								Wanshi	Ah... is it?	1																					
41	41		301								Wanshi	I thought... no commandant would come to such a shabby shooting range on the weekends.	1																					
42	42		301									Wanshi looks up as he says this. You follow and notice a note on the wall that says "Wanshi's Resting Place".																						
43	43		302								Already claimed the place for yourself?	44																						
44	44		301								Wanshi	Uh-huh.	1																					
45	45		302								What you said earlier was very insightful.	46																						
46	46		301								Wanshi	...Well, I suppose.	1																					
47	47		301								Wanshi	...	1																					
48	48		301								Wanshi	...Are you waiting for me to say something?	1																					
49	49		302								Eh.	50																						
50	50		301								Wanshi	...I'm not obligated to keep teaching you. I'm already getting tired from talking so much...	1																					
51	51		302								Alright.	53																						
52	52		204							1	4																							
53	53		301								Wanshi	...Right? Sniping is a tactic, not a gun.	1																					
54	54		301								Wanshi	...Sure, if you're just looking for long-range accuracy, the advanced sniper rifles with their fire-control systems can indeed allow a toddler hit a target miles away with just a few hours of training.	1																					
55	55		204							1	8																							
56	56		301								Wanshi	But fighting in a war is different than shooting at a range, isn't it? Marksmanship is the least important part of real combats.	1																					
57	57		204							1																								
58	58		301								Wanshi	So... no, there's no need to obsess over marksmanship.	1																					
59	59		301								Wanshi	As a commandant, you're useful enough in tactical deployment.	1																					
60	60		302							499	Thanks for the consolation, I guess?	63	Is that why you let me win during the training last time?	65																				
61	61		204							1	8																							
62	62		303							499																								
63	63		301								Wanshi	I'm just telling it like it is...	1																					
64	64	71	204							1																								
65	65		301								Wanshi	Oh... you've found out.	1																					
66	66		204							1																								
67	67		302								It was pretty obvious.	68																						
68	68		301								Wanshi	Captain told me not to knock out the commandants with my first shot during the simulation to leave room for "rehearsals"... Besides, I had no idea it was you that I was up against.	1																					
69	69		302								Would you act differently if you knew?	70																						
70	70		301								Wanshi	I'd act... a little bit more convincing.	1																					
71	71		301								Wanshi	Well... anyway, you've had some good shots here. Can you finish training now?	1																					
72	72		204							1	8																							
73	73		301								Wanshi	If... you're to train here the whole day, I won't be able to... sleep...	1																					
74	74		302								You're already sleeping!	75																						
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		301									The faint murmur across you gradually quiets down, and you receive no response after waiting for a while.																						
77	77		302								...	78	Then I'll leave you to rest.	78																				
78	78		301								Wanshi	For humans, your stamina determines the threshold of your marksmanship.																						
79	79		301									Just as you walk toward the exit of the training room, you hear Wanshi speaking once again, as if talking to himself.																						
80	80		301								Wanshi	...Don't overexert yourself. You'll just lower the threshold.																						
81	81		302								I see.	82																						
82	82		301									There is no response for real this time. Wanshi curls up against the wall, seemingly having already fallen asleep.																						
83	83		301									Although you know that Constructs do not get tired from unhealthy sleeping positions, you still cannot help but feel bad seeing him falling "asleep" in this awkward pose.																						
84	84		301									You recall the memory foam pillow that WGAA sent you a while ago. It was designed for humans... but perhaps it can be a gift of appreciation for Wanshi, seeing how he is sleeping now.																						
85	85		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					With this in mind, you close the door for Wanshi as you leave the old shooting range.
