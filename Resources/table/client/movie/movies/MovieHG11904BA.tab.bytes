4	4		301									Through those letters, you can feel Iris's joy at finding a best friend.																						
5	5		301									The days go by and through the descriptions in the letters, the other girl starts to take shape.																						
6	6		301									From time to time, she and Iris would have a huge fight over some minute differences in ideas. Yet, the next moment, they would spend all day and night deep in discussion because they found new common ground.																						
7	7		301									To think that in a world like this, there are people who are bothered by things like this.																						
8	8		301									While thinking about how inconceivable this is, you also feel a subtle sense of gratification.

16	16		304							Please forgive my recent lack of correspondence. It's just that after things starting falling in place, I haven't had much time to myself.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
17	17		304							The World Government Association of Art contacted me recently, telling me they really love my operas.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
18	18		304							They're giving me an opportunity to have my play performed in the Grand Opera House of Babylonia.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
19	19		304							As such, I've been spending my days and nights making preparations.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
20	20		304							Writing the libretto, composing the music... I've decided to base it on the Acadia Evacuation.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	21		304							A is helping me as well, of course. Every day, we discuss how to set up the scenery so that everything's perfect.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
22	22		304							I've gained enough experience and I've never doubted my own talent. I have absolute confidence in myself.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
23	23		304							But for some reason that I can't explain, I'm panicking.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
24	24		304							My audience is growing larger, cheering for me and supporting my operas.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
25	25		304							But this panic feels like quicksand, pulling me deeper and deeper in.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
26	26		304							I don't know why I'm panicking. I've pondered over it for a long time, but I don't know what it is that I'm missing.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	27		304							I don't dare to unload this on A. She's busy concentrating on her own art and I can't disturb her at this time.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	28		304							In the past, when I gazed up at the stars in the sky, all I saw was unparalleled beauty.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
29	29		304							But now, when I gaze up at those same stars, all I feel is an unbearable emptiness.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
30	30		304							My opera will be performed the day after tomorrow, and yet here I am, cowering.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
31	31		304							I feel so lost, and so I write to you for help.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
32	32		304							This is incredibly selfish of me. How could I be so mean as to heap my problems on you?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
33	33		304							But I trust you, unconditionally. You've always been so strong. You've always managed to get me back on track.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
34	34		304							Please tell me, ã€kuronameã€‘ï¼Œwhat is it that I'm missing?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

36	36		304							I had hoped that our first meeting wouldn't be under such dire circumstances, but alas, it's unavoidable.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

39	39		301									Written down, then erased; written down, then erased again; written down, then erased once more.																						
40	40		301									Her hesitation and urgency are only veiled with a sheet of paper.

48	48		301									Follow-up missions and lengthy combat exercises have kept you busy every day. You do not even have the time and opportunity to check your mail, let alone attend a date.																						
49	49		301									Another month passes in the blink of an eye.																						
50	50		301									You open your mailbox to find it stuffed full of letters.																						
51	51		301									They are all from Iris.																						
52	52		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You open each one, carefully reading through them.																						
53	53		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				You weren't in my audience. I'm pretty sure of that.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
54	54		304							Because even though we've never met, I'm sure I can recognize your face at a glance.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
55	55		304							I had been waiting for you, but I didn't see you even when the performance ended. I guess you didn't have time. I believe you didn't have time.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
56	56		304							You're a soldier, so it must have been something that you had no say inâ€”That's what I tell myself.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
57	57		304							Although I must admit I was dismayed, I'm really glad you didn't come to see the opera.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
58	58		304							It was such a novice attempt, so much so that I wouldn't feel comfortable showing it to you. Had you seen it, you would have been disappointed in me.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
59	59		304							After the performance ended, I found the reason for my panic.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
60	60		304							"Using the libretto and music to convey your inner world to others... I feel that it's an especially meaningful endeavor."	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
61	61		304							I seem to have written this in one of my previous letters, didn't I?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
62	62		304							I've been in such a hurry that I ended up becoming the type of person I used to dislike.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
63	63		304							Along the way, I'd somehow lost sight of my ideals and my dreams.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
64	64		304							I'd stopped examining every libretto I wrote and my arrogance hurt others. This pains me.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
65	65		304							A long time ago, I felt that Babylonia was such a small place.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
66	66		304							So much so that sending letters never took more than a day.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
67	67		304							Now more than ever, I realize why it's so small.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
68	68		304							It comes across as comfortable and cozy because I've been a frog in a well.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
69	69		304							From my limited perspective, I depicted a ridiculous representation of the world and actually thought it was the real thing.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
70	70		304							If I want to capture the real world on canvas and create real art, I shouldn't stay here.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

73	73		304							I strongly believe this, and so I've made the biggest decision of my life.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
74	74		304							I wish you could be physically here with me and listen to me telling you this. And then, just as always, tell me what I should do.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
75	75		304							But this time, I can't wait any longer. This is my decision and my responsibility to bear. I can't push them to you.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

84	84		304							I've clutched it all day and night, contemplating how best to write you this letter.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
85	85		304							When you use it, it'll be as if I was holding your hand close to my heart.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1
