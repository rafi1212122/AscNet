3	3		301			DialogEnable						Despite saying it is late, Chrome does not seem to be in a hurry to part ways as you two leave the library.																						
4	4		302								Back to the classroom?	5

6	6		301							1	Chrome	Our game of chess hasn't ended yet, has it?	1

8	8		301									You tilt your head and look at him.																						
9	9		301									You seem to understand what he was thinking during that long stretch of silence.																						
10	10		301									He might have figured it out then.																						
11	11		301									If you were from the same year as him, the two of you would have done what you just did.																						
12	12		301									You would read in the library together, discuss philosophy the way you did, stroll on the training fields around campus, and play chess in the classroom after class.																						
13	13		301									After all, you have done the same at the same places... at different times.

16	16		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You are back to where you ran into each other.																						
17	17		301									The two of you return to your seats.																						
18	18		301									The holographic chessboard lights up between you.																						
19	19		401							1	37																							
20	20		301									The pieces on it are still where you left them.																						
21	21		201							1	500309																							
22	22		301							1	Chrome	It was my turn, so now it's yours, 【kuroname】.	1																					
23	23		302								Alright, then...	24																						
24	24		202							1					1																			
25	25		301									White Knight moves from H4 to F5.																						
26	26		302								Has your mood gone better?	27																						
27	27		301									Black Pawn moves from C7 to C6.																						
28	28		201							1	500309																							
29	29		301							1	Chrome	There's no "better mood." It is inconsequential at the end of the day. I've just realized something.	1																					
30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301									White Pawn moves from G2 to G4.																						
32	32		302								And what is that?	33																						
33	33		301									Black Knight moves from H5 to F6.																						
34	34		201							1	500309																							
35	35		301							1	Chrome	We'll talk after the game.	1																					
36	36		302								Sure.	37

38	38		301									White Knight moves from H1 to G1.																						
39	39		301									...																						
40	40		301									The battle on the chessboard grows more intense.																						
41	41		301									...																						
42	42		301									In the end—																						
43	43		301									White Queen moves from F3 to F6.																						
44	44		301									Chrome's clutched fists press against his lips, him pausing to consider.																						
45	45		201							1	500309																							
46	46		301							1	Chrome	You sacrificed your Bishop on your 11th move.	1																					
47	47		301								Chrome	You sacrificed both of your Rooks on your 18th move.	1																					
48	48		301								Chrome	Now you're sacrificing your Queen.	1																					
49	49		301								Chrome	You have fewer pieces than I do.	1																					
50	50		302								You know what I've been thinking about.	51																						
51	51		301								Chrome	I do.	1

53	53		301									He picks up the Black Knight on G8 and takes your White Queen, placed on F6 as bait.																						
54	54		301									In response, you pick up the White Bishop on D6...																						
55	55		301									And move it to E7.																						
56	56		302								Checkmate.	57																						
57	57		301									The game is over.																						
58	58		301									Chrome does not look disappointed, and you do not look gleeful either.																						
59	59		301									You just stare at each other for a while before breaking into smiles.																						
60	60		201							1	500309	1																						
61	61		301							1	Chrome	When did you hatch this plan?	1																					
62	62		302								Same time as you did.	63																						
63	63		301								Chrome	From the very beginning, then.	1																					
64	64		401							1	49																							
65	65		302								The "Immortal Game".	66																						
66	66		301								Chrome	Exactly.	1																					
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		301									Chrome and you have actually been replicating a legendary chess game.																						
69	69		301									This has been a contest, but it has not been one, too. It was not a game of chess, but a game of minds.																						
70	70		301									You were both gambling on the hope that the other person would make the expected move.																						
71	71		302								That's my "answer," Chrome.	72																						
72	72		301									The number of active pieces is way more important than the number of pieces a player has. Despite the inevitability of the circumstances, there are always those who can break through the boundaries and forge new paths.																						
73	73		301									There are always those who think alike, who are willing to forge a new path with you.																						
74	74		301									Those of Us, or Other.																						
75	75		301									The most important thing is to understand each other and look for a possibility together.																						
76	76		301									Even if Chrome is a Construct, and you are a human...																						
77	77		302								I'm sitting right here.	78																						
78	78		201							1	500309	1																						
79	79		301							1	Chrome	Yes. You're right in front of me.	1																					
80	80		301									You find yourself reflected in his eyes, his blue irises as all-encompassing as the ocean.																						
81	81		302								Not only me.	82																						
82	82		301								Chrome	No. Not only you.	1																					
83	83		202							1					1																			
84	84		301									Without love and kindness, the power of technology will only be the power to hurt.																						
85	85		301									That is it, you think. If there is no love and kindness.																						
86	86		301									But not all humans have been selfish and foolish.																						
87	87		201							1	500309																							
88	88		301							1	Chrome	Can I expect more games like this, 【kuroname】?	1																					
89	89		202							1					1																			
90	90		301									Understanding each other even when you are competing.																						
91	91		301									Choosing the same path even when you stand on different sides.																						
92	92		302								I think so.	93																						
93	93		301									You make a promise.																						
94	94		301									There will be more games like this.																						
95	95		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					It is a promise... and a vow.
