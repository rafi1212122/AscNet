11	11		301									It is no gentle light. It is a little harsh, a little fierce, and even a little... dry.																						
12	12		301									Light scatters and finally begins to take shape after quite some time.																						
13	13		301									The light forms into the shape of a face.																						
14	14		301									Vera's face fills your vision.

18	18		301							1	Vera	【kuroname】. You're awake.	1																					
19	19		302								Huh?!	20																						
20	20		204							1	2																							
21	21		301								Vera	Time to wake up. Any longer and I might just pull a prank on you.	1																					
22	22		302								What were you planning on doing?	23																						
23	23		301								Vera	Now that's more like it. That's the sort of question I like to answer. Looks like you're recovering just fine.	1																					
24	24		301								Vera	What if I were to say you already died and went to Heaven?	1																					
25	25		204							1	1																							
26	26		301								Vera	Bahahaha! Looks like you're outta luck. No angels await you in paradise—there is only Death.	1																					
27	27		301									Vera smiles to herself. She turns to sit beside you on the bed and casts a sideways glance.																						
28	28		302								Where am I?	29																						
29	29		204							1	2																							
30	30		301								Vera	I told you. You're in Heaven.	1																					
31	31		302								...	32																						
32	32		204							1																								
33	33		301								Vera	...You're no fun. Fine. It's the field clinic. There were dozens of patients here before, but now there's just you.	1																					
34	34		301								Vera	Actually, that's not entirely correct. Before you woke up, there were in fact dozens of people in here. They were crowded all around you, and they only left after I told them to let you rest.	1																					
35	35		301									Listening to Vera speak, you turn your head and notice all of the footprints around your bed.																						
36	36		301									A majority of the footprints are centered around the foot of your bed. You see several wildflowers scattered on the headboard, with dozens more on the ground nearby.																						
37	37		301									For the people living in this new conservation area, this seems to be the best way for residents to express their concerns. Of course, most of them were cleared aside by Vera to avoid potentially exposing you to harmful bacteria.																						
38	38		301								Vera	Someone sure is popular here.	1																					
39	39		204							1	1																							
40	40		301								Vera	They really care about you even though they've only known you for a few days. If this were Babylonia, they'd be seen as unsophisticated, wouldn't they?	1																					
41	41		302								...The people here are nice.	42																						
42	42		204							1																								
43	43		301								Vera	Is that so?	1																					
44	44		301									Noncommittal, Vera twirls her hair with a finger as she sits next to you.																						
45	45		301								Vera	...Why didn't you want to use that reagent?	1																					
46	46		301									Suddenly, she puts down her finger and begins to speak quietly.																						
47	47		302								Sorry?	48																						
48	48		301								Vera	That inhibitor dispersant. You didn't forget, did you?	1																					
49	49		301								Vera	You were surrounded by scrapped Constructs. If one or two are damaged, what's the big deal?	1																					
50	50		301				DialogDisable				Vera	You wouldn't have needed surgery, considering how big of a crybaby you were from all the pain. And you wouldn't be lying here like a damn fool.	1																					
51	51		302								I wasn't a crybaby...	52																						
52	52		302								Also, I can't just use some random Construct's frame.	53	Also, I know you're just messing with me.	59																				
53	53		204							1	1																							
54	54		301			DialogEnable					Vera	Pff... You actually believed all that?	1																					
55	55		301									Vera looks up at you. Her mouth is slightly cocked into a funny expression.																						
56	56		301								Vera	If there really were such a magical elixir that could save humans, why would they hide it in a Construct's frame?	1																					
57	57		301								Vera	Field doctors aren't stupid. Not a single one would choose to hide it, let alone keep it a secret for this long.	1																					
58	58	64	301								Vera	Any field doctor that refused to save the living over the "dignity of the dead" would've been expelled from the Army ages ago.	1																					
59	59		204							1	13																							
60	60		301			DialogEnable					Vera	Pff... Aren't you clever?	1																					
61	61		301									In all actuality, you have figured as much from the very beginning.																						
62	62		301									In principle, any medicine that could save a human's life would be carried by them, not hidden in a Construct's frame.																						
63	63		301									Not to mention, any technology that could bring humans back from the dead would have had its cover blown right after being used the first time. For as long as Construct technology has been around, there is no way it could be kept a secret this long.																						
64	64		204							1	4																							
65	65		301								Vera	The inverse scale inhibitor dispersant or whatever it's called was just a dumb joke. The thing I showed you was really just a gift from the Scavengers. Looks like jewelry from their group. Liquid-filled... How romantic.	1																					
66	66		302								...Why joke about something like that?	67																						
67	67		204							1	2																							
68	68		301								Vera	What's the matter?	1																					
69	69		204							1	4																							
70	70		301								Vera	Maybe it's because some people don't fight their hardest to live on the battlefield. They have to pray for some higher power to save them. Damn idiots.	1																					
71	71		204							1	13																							
72	72		301								Vera	If they're so fond of being fooled, what's the harm in making up a stupid little story?	1																					
73	73		302								You ever pulled that on anyone else before?	74																						
74	74		204							1	2																							
75	75		301								Vera	Heh, what do you think? Looking at the confused look on your face while I told that story was at least a little fun.	1																					
76	76		301								Vera	I wasn't expecting your reaction to be even more boring than this story.	1																					
77	77		301								Vera	I really was hoping you'd cry and beg others to give up their lives to save you.	1																					
78	78		302								I said I'd never do that.	79	(Remain silent)	79																				
79	79		301								Vera	Oh, I know. After all, you're 【kuroname】, "Chief" of Babylonia.	1																					
80	80		301									Vera lifts her palms up, tilts her head and smiles again. This time it is not as eccentric as it was before. Instead, it is more like the "Companion Construct" she played in the conservation area.																						
81	81		302								...If I told you I wanted to live, what would you have done?	82																						
82	82		204							1																								
83	83		301									You suddenly ask her out of the blue.																						
84	84		301									Vera's eyes widen as if caught off guard.																						
85	85		301									Shortly after, her expression changes to a cold smile.																						
86	86		204							1	13																							
87	87		301								Vera	Well, then I'd save you.	1																					
88	88		301								Vera	After all, I gave you that foolish ounce of hope. It's my duty to save you.	1																					
89	89		301								Vera	No matter where you are, no matter how troublesome the operation is, and no matter how you cry during the operation, I will save you.	1																					
90	90		301								Vera	Of course, if you got reckless on the field because of this inhibitor dispersant, then you'd be really putting me on the spot. I'd have to dispose of your dumbass.	1																					
91	92		301									As she speaks, Vera raises a finger and draws a line across her neck.																						
92	93		301									She speaks with determination, like a doctor taking an oath. But her expression is still cold and arrogant, sending a chill down your spine.																						
93	94		301									This is quintessential Vera—always ruthlessly blunt and brutally honest about her feelings. Her heart is like a rose, making it hard for anyone to get past the thorns.																						
94	95		301									But you seem to be making your way past the thorns, exposing the delicate stem.																						
95	96		204							1	13																							
96	97		301								Vera	...What's wrong? Scared? Well, stay in bed until the follow-up examination is complete. Don't want you dying on me after all of that. I took care of the Giant Corrupted. You can take a break now.	1																					
97	98		301				DialogDisable				Vera	Anyway, after this mission, you can go back to your lovey-dovey team and spill the beans to those dumb commandants.	1																					
98	99		302								Hold on!	100																						
99	100		302								You've told this joke before?	101																						
100	101		204							1	2																							
101	102		301			DialogEnable					Vera	Oops... Guess the cat's out of the bag.	1																					
102	103		301									Vera's mouth begins to raise into that peculiar smile again. You cannot tell if she actually let it slip or if she is just playing you again.																						
103	104		301								Vera	What's wrong? I came up with a story. Of course I needed to tell it to others.	1																					
104	105		301								Vera	I don't know how many people I've told it to now, but none of the other commandants I've told the story to are still breathing... Psych! They're all alive and well.	1																					
105	106		204							1	1																							
106	107		301								Vera	But they were all just like you... So boring I just wanted to knock them out.	1																					
107	108		302								What'd they do?	109																						
108	109		204							1	2																							
109	110		301								Vera	Oh... They all chose to take the initiative to forget this thing.	1																					
110	111		301								Vera	Maybe it's for self-protection or something. Anyway, when I talked about this thing, they'd all say that they wouldn't mention it to anyone and they would never use it.	1																					
111	112		301								Vera	They kept it a secret even after some battle or disaster left them bedridden in a hospital. Hah, dumbasses. As boring as they come.	1																					
112	113		301								Vera	As for why they didn't say anything? Well, several of them mentioned your name.	1																					
113	114		301								Vera	Seems like your leadership has left quite the impression on those around you. You're like their "banner."	1																					
114	115		302								That's... not a bad thing, is it?	116																						
115	116		204							1																								
116	117		301								Vera	Hmph, of course not. It might be stupid. It might be boring. But it isn't bad.	1																					
117	118		301								Vera	And it ruins my fun.	1

119	120		301			RImgBg1Shake						Ka-CHA! Vera releases the top half of your bed, causing your upper body to fall all of a sudden. Feeling dizzy for a moment, you look up to see a dim yellow light and Vera's face shrouded in the backlight.																						
120	121		204							1	13																							
121	122		301								Vera	Since you stole my fun, I should take it back from you. Isn't that right? You silly "banner" of the commandants.	1																					
122	123		301								Vera	Well, time for you to get some rest. Remain in bed and refrain from moving until tomorrow.	1																					
123	124		301								Vera	Of course, we're all out of pain medication. Be prepared, dear Commandant!	1
