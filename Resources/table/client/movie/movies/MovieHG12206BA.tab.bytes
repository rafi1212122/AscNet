3	3		301			DialogEnable						The next visit you make to Vera's tent happens in a morning.																						
4	4		301									You see her hair awkwardly off to the side in a loose ponytail, which seems at odds with how you usually see her.																						
5	5		201							1	500345																							
6	6		301							1	Vera	【kuroname】. You're awake.	1																					
7	7		301									Seeing you come in, she lets go of her hair and it flows freely.																						
8	8		302								Gotta hand it to your TLC...	9	There's not a single part of me that isn't in pain...	9																				
9	9		204							1	13																							
10	10		301								Vera	You seem re-energized. I take it you want to spend your hard-earned vacation stuck in bed?	1																					
11	11		302								Forget I said anything...	12																						
12	12		301									As Vera had said, now that the Corrupted threat to the conservation area has been greatly reduced, the Engineering Force and Task Force have enough manpower to complete their original work as intended. Right before the mission is about to be over, you get to enjoy some much-needed R&R.																						
13	13		301									On the first day of your vacation, you visit Vera's tent and run into her right as she appears to be getting ready for hibernation.																						
14	14		204							1																								
15	15		301								Vera	Oh, one more thing...	1																					
16	16		301									You are suddenly eclipsed by a large bouquet of flowers.																						
17	17		301								Vera	Next time, keep your crap to yourself.	1																					
18	18		301									It is a bouquet of wildflowers. Obviously, it is a gift from the Scavengers here. While you were resting in the clinic, your bedside was covered in them. Some may have even come from the Constructs.																						
19	19		301									But this time, these flowers are not for you. They are for Vera.																						
20	20		301									You just secretly stashed them in here while Vera was out.																						
21	21		301								Vera	I told you. Saving these people and taking care of their enemies were just a part of the mission.	1																					
22	22		301								Vera	If they died because of the Punishing Virus, I'd also be the one responsible for giving them an autopsy in front of everyone. I'd rip them apart more than the Corrupted.	1																					
23	23		301								Vera	So, don't give me this crap. I've never understood the point of giving people flowers.	1																					
24	24		302								No, you should take it.	25	(Throw the flowers back at her)	26																				
25	25	27	301									You throw the flowers back to Vera as you tell her.																						
26	26		301									You throw the flowers back to Vera without saying a word.																						
27	27		301									As expected, the flowers and stems all scatter onto the floor.																						
28	28		204							1	4																							
29	29		301								Vera	What the hell are you doing? Are you kidding me? I worked so hard to save you and now you're acting like a child. How can you be this childish?	1																					
30	30		301								Vera	Whatever. The mission is almost over. I don't care what these people think of me.	1																					
31	31		204							1	2																							
32	32		301								Vera	I pretended to care at first because I thought it would save me some trouble, but you've been more trouble than the entire conservation area.	1																					
33	33		301								Vera	If you want people to praise you here, then have at it. I've had to kick people out while you were getting some rest. I'm sure you can even hear them right now if you go out.	1																					
34	34		302								You've been staying here this whole time?	35																						
35	35		204							1																								
36	36		301								Vera	I'd be held responsible if I just left and you died here. If that happens, I'm sure Nikola's going to be so pissed that we'd send him to an early grave.	1																					
37	37		204							1	13																							
38	38		301								Vera	—Oh, I've got a better idea. Why don't you go get yourself killed right now?	1																					
39	39		302								Oh, no. Spare me.	46	Wow! You care so much! I'm so happy!	40																				
40	40		204							1	4																							
41	41		301								Vera	...	1																					
42	42		301									The moment you say this, Vera's disdainful look turns ice cold. Even though Constructs do not eat or experience stomach pain, she looks like she has eaten one of Lucia's culinary creations.	1																					
43	43		302								How's that for a response?	44	You said the same thing to me.	44																				
44	44		301								Vera	Looks like you need more time to rest...	1																					
45	45		302								I'm sorry! I'm sorry!	46																						
46	46		204							1	2																							
47	47		301								Vera	Hmph... Since I'm in a good mood, we can save the fun for later.	1																					
48	48		301								Vera	I saved your life, now get away from me. Enjoy your vacation.	1																					
49	49		302								You don't want to do anything?	50																						
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301								Vera	Me? Do what? They all know the real me now. Think I'm interested in having everyone glare at me like some sorta Corrupted while they fawn over how great you are? No, thanks.	1																					
52	52		301				DialogDisable				Vera	I didn't expect the Gray Raven Commandant to stoop this low, getting enjoyment from torturing me like that.	1																					
53	53		302								About that...	54																						
54	54		302								I told everyone about you.	55																						
55	55		302								Included the "Death" bit.	56																						
56	56		301			DialogEnable						For a moment, you catch Vera's eyebrows rise stiffly. Her venomous tongue is silent.																						
57	57		204							1	8																							
58	58		301								Vera	...Is this some sort of revenge?	1																					
59	59		301									But that was only a moment. The next second, her fierce demeanor returns to her face with more intensity than before.																						
60	60		204							1																								
61	61		301								Vera	Whatever. I don't care how they treat me. They mean nothing to me.	1																					
62	62		301								Vera	But that's pretty bold of you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
63	63		301								Vera	Is this an act of revenge? Are you done being partners? Or—	1																					
64	64		301									Vera becomes quiet for a moment before carrying on with an intense, threatening tone.																						
65	65		204							1	13																							
66	66		301								Vera	Or are you afraid of me, too?	1																					
67	67		301									She raises her hand and places it on her banner spear, which has been standing against the side of the tent for the past several days.																						
68	68		301									She points the tip at you, whistling as it glides through the air.																						
69	69		302								(But you can dodge out of it)	70	Your next move... is a swipe to the head!	70																				
70	70		301									You quickly react to the incoming banner spear and avoid the whirlwind despite not having fully recovered from your wounds.																						
71	71		301									Step one, a swipe to the head. Step two, a leg sweep. Step three, a thrust to the body. Had she attacked you before the mission, she would have easily defeated you. But you are already wise to her tactics.																						
72	72		301									Having danced with the rose over the past several days, you now know how to avoid the thorns.																						
73	73		302								Step four, charge!	74																						
74	74		301									Seeing her banner spear falter a moment, you grab the hilt.																						
75	75		204							1																								
76	76		301								Vera	Well, then.	1																					
77	77		301									The moment you grasp the hilt of her banner spear, a look of surprise floats up onto Vera's gorgeous face.																						
78	78		204							1	2																							
79	79		301								Vera	Well done. I underestimated you.	1																					
80	80		302								Seems like I'm getting to know you more.	81	That's because I already know your combat style.	81																				
81	81		301									Thanks to this mission, you already know how Vera fights in battle.																						
82	82		301									Unrestrained and unconcerned with others. But that does not mean that she will reject others' support.																						
83	83		301									In reality, her actions are not nearly as random as what she exhibits.																						
84	84		301									Roses may be thorny, but the thorns are not everywhere. If you are careful, you can avoid them.																						
85	85		204							1	13																							
86	86		301								Vera	Oh? really?	1																					
87	87		301									Vera is quiet for a moment and chuckles. As soon as she swings her banner spear, you get pulled toward her.																						
88	88		301								Vera	Can you predict this attack, too?	1																					
89	89		301									She follows your movement and quickly grabs your hand.																						
90	90		301									...Looks like no matter how familiar you are with a rose, a thorn may still catch you off guard.																						
91	91		301								Vera	Didn't you hold that girl's hand like this to comfort her? You did good. You seemed like a real professional.	1																					
92	92		301								Vera	What about now? Why don't you show me how professional you really are.	1																					
93	93		301									She begins to clench down on your hand with force, causing your knuckles to start popping.																						
94	94		302								Ouch...!	95	Rgh...! Ouch...!	96																				
95	95	97	301								Vera	Good. Cry louder.	1																					
96	96		301								Vera	Look! Doesn't that make you a crybaby?	1																					
97	97		301								Vera	Hurts, doesn't it? A special characteristic of this frame is its high power output. When I first transferred into it, I was accidentally breaking things all the time.	1																					
98	98		301								Vera	I can't say that I'm particularly good at controlling it. Maybe if I'm not careful, I'll shatter your arm. You'll have to stay in this hospital bed for another three months. Of course, there isn't any of that inhibitor dispersant crap in Babylonia to save you.	1																					
99	99		301				DialogDisable				Vera	How about now? Do you know pain? This is how I make Constructs feel. If you don't want to suffer such deadly pain ever again, I recommend you stay the hell away from me.	1																					
100	100		302								But...	101																						
101	101		302								Doesn't this pain prove that they're living?	102																						
102	102		302								The "Death" who gave them such proof should not be treated like this.	103																						
103	103		204							1																								
104	104		301			DialogEnable					Vera	...	1																					
105	105		301									Without a word, Vera just gradually increases her strength. You hear the sound of your wrist cracking.																						
106	106		302								(My arm's going to break!)	107	(My arm... My commandant power!)	107																				
107	107		201							1	500260																							
108	108		301							1	Scavenger Girl	Miss! Miss!	1																					
109	109		301									A tender voice saves you from the possibility of your arm breaking. The little girl you saw in this tent earlier stands at the entrance as she shouts over to the two of you.																						
110	110		203							1	0.25	-400																						
111	111		201							2	500345		400																					
112	112		301							1	Vera	What?	2																					
113	113		301									Vera maintains her vice grip on your arm. Her head does not turn to look at the girl.																						
114	114		301								Scavenger Girl	Miss Death, h-hurry! My grandma has a gift for you!	1																					
115	115		301									Hearing the girl call her by her nickname, Vera's grip loosens for a moment.																						
116	116		301								Vera	Hmph.	2																					
117	117		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Then, reluctantly, she throws your hand to the side and follows the girl out of the tent.																						
118	118		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory5.jpg																								
119	119		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The sun finally comes out for the first time after days of haze covering the conservation area. The sunlight is bright and warm, but also gentle.																						
120	120		301								Scavenger Girl	Miss, you saved me. I haven't said thank you.	1																					
121	121		301								Scavenger Girl	I heard Commandant 【kuroname】 say that your nickname is Death. Is that right, Miss?	1																					
122	122		301								Scavenger Girl	Grandma says that Death is the one who controls life and death. I'm very glad you didn't choose for me to die, Miss.	1																					
123	123		301									The little girl's voice is frail, having not fully recovered from her illness. She cautiously smiles at Vera, which compliments the wildflowers in her arms.																						
124	124		301									Vera quietly follows her with a solemn expression on her face. The Constructs and Scavengers seem to be blown back a few steps by the contrasting presence of the pair.																						
125	125		301									By chance, you catch two Constructs whispering.																						
126	126		301								Construct A	She seemed really dignified when I first saw her. I can't believe she's the legendary Death...																						
127	127		301								Construct B	I had my doubts before 【kuroname】 said anything... Aren't you afraid of her being here?																						
128	128		301								Construct A	I was afraid at first, but seeing her in person isn't much better.																						
129	129		301								Construct A	But... seeing how she desperately saved 【kuroname】, I was more in awe than afraid. Maybe she's always like that when on a mission.																						
130	130		301								Construct A	If you think about it, the only targets she kills are mission objectives... Can we really hate doctors and soldiers on our side like that?																						
131	131		301									Their conversation fades into the distance. It is faint, but you can still hear them.																						
132	132		301									Vera seems not to hear the entire conversation. She just follows the girl, who stops in front of an elderly woman. The woman is sitting on the ground with petals scattered around her feet.																						
133	133		202							1	2				1																			
134	134		201							1	500251																							
135	135		301							1	Scavenger Elder	I heard you're "Death" from those Babylonia folks?	1																					
136	136		301								Scavenger Elder	Hehe, that's an interesting name. When I was young, I was also called the Colorful Black Dahlia.	1																					
137	137		201							1	500345																							
138	138		301							1	Vera	(Chuckles)	1																					
139	139		301									You do not know whether it is an illusion or something else. Vera's expression remains unchanged, but you somehow manage to hear a strange laugh.																						
140	140		201							1	500251																							
141	141		301							1	Scavenger Elder	Haha! You see, nicknames can carry many different meanings. Many of which might have nothing to do with you. No one should use this to define people.	1																					
142	142		201							1	500260																							
143	143		301							1	Scavenger Girl	Yeah! We can give each other lots of nicknames...	1																					
144	144		301								Scavenger Girl	Well, Miss, your name is Death. What about me? How about... Bread Angel? Or Noodle Angel? I've been wanting bread ever since before I came to the conservation area.	1																					
145	145		301								Scavenger Girl	Alright! I'm the Bread Angel! So... What about 【kuroname】? How about the God of Resurrection...	1																					
146	146		302								Sounds good!	147	Is there really a god like that?	148																				
147	147	149	301								Scavenger Girl	Alright, yeah! Actually... I don't know if there is a God of Resurrection. But if there is one for Death, there has to be one for Life, right? Otherwise, how lonely it'd be...	1																					
148	148		301								Scavenger Girl	Um, uh... I'm not sure. But if there is one for Death, there has to be one for Life, right? Otherwise, how lonely it'd be...	1																					
149	149		301								Scavenger Girl	Anyway! This is the gift we wanted to give you, Miss Death! Of course, 【kuroname】 gets a gift too!	1																					
150	150		301									Saying this, the girl holds up a small wreath of flowers.																						
151	151		301				DialogDisable					It is a wreath woven with wildflowers around the conservation area, with a small glass tube tied in it. The vibrant green is shining in the sunlight.																						
152	152		302								Fresh flowers, praise, and a charm.	153																						
153	153		302								This is the treatment "Death" deserves.	154

155	155		301			DialogEnable				1	Vera	Hmph...	1																					
156	156		301									Vera hooks her finger over the wreath and throws it several times in the air. She stares at the arc drawn by the bright light reflected from the glass tube, too distracted to wear it.																						
157	157		301									She suddenly shakes her hand and straightens her fingers, sending the wreath flying at your head.																						
158	158		301								Vera	Hey. Put it on.	1																					
159	159		301									She orders you in her usual, unquestionably tone.																						
160	160		302								M-me?	161																						
161	161		301								Vera	Look how dumb it is. Suits you.	1																					
162	162		301									There is no reason to oppose her request. All you can do with it is wear it on your head.																						
163	163		302								What do you think?	164																						
164	164		301								Vera	Hehe, not bad. Not bad at all.	1																					
165	165		302								Me or the wreath?	166																						
166	166		301								Vera	Who knows?	1																					
167	167		301								Vera	Maybe in the future, I'll give you something more than a wreath.	1																					
168	168		302								Come again?	169																						
169	169		204							1																								
170	170		301								Vera	As you know, Constructs have many secrets. These secrets bear too heavy of a burden to carry alone. Some may need to be shared with some innocent bystander.	1																					
171	171		301								Vera	Yes, for example, a strange commandant who foolishly believes or pretends to believe everything a certain Construct says—	1																					
172	172		204							1	2																							
173	173		301									Vera suddenly turns her head and gives you a foreboding smile.																						
174	174		301									Panic fills your mind for a moment. Is she going to tell more lies and do more crazy nonsense that will make your hair stand on end?																						
175	175		301									Or will she simply do nothing and revel in your panic?																						
176	176		301									—After a few seconds, she still continues to smile at you, unflinching. In fact, her smile has never been out of good intentions.	1																					
177	177		301									Somehow, this panic gradually changes into a sense of peace.																						
178	178		202							1					1																			
179	179		301									If she is going to lie, you will just continue to be skeptical. If she intends to frighten you, you should be prepared to be frightened.																						
180	180		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					In any case, this thorny rose seems to be willing to retract her thorns and allow you to get closer.	1
