3	3		301			DialogEnable						It's just a small badge with the logo of F.O.S. printed on it, nothing luxurious. It's not made from any rare material either.																						
4	4		301									This object isn't worth much to most people, but it means a lot to you. It is a souvenir to your time spent in F.O.S., but also an alarm to remind you of the oath you once made.																						
5	5		301									Of course, it never blocked any lethal bullet like in the stories.																						
6	6		301									When you face difficult decisions, you always look at it, for it can help you to find your true self.																						
7	7		301									When stress makes you want to run away, it is always there to remind you of your identity, responsibility, and every single person that has been backing you up along the way.																						
8	8		301									It is like an old friend that has survived countless difficult battles together with you. Maybe time will wear it down and one day you will have to put it away in a box, but you cannot let it disappear like this.

13	13		301							1	Pulao	That's very important! How can you still be so calm?	1																					
14	14		301									Pulao looks more anxious than you. She bends down and starts looking for the badge.																						
15	15		301								Pulao	Let's search here for any possible clue. Don't worry, Commandant! I will get it back for you.	1																					
16	16		301								Pulao	It's all my fault. If I wasn't so overjoyed, they wouldn't have the chance. If only I could pay more attention to the surroundings...	1																					
17	17		301									Guilt and remorse are slowly eroding her. Pulao has done nothing wrong, but her sense of duty cannot allow herself to let her guard down.																						
18	18		302								Don't worry. It's actually a good thing.	19																						
19	19		301								Pulao	You don't need to console me, Commandant. I will cheer myself up. Those thieves won't get away, I promise.	1																					
20	20		301								Pulao	I know very well how it feels to lose something important. It's like... my past, present and future are all missing a piece.	1																					
21	21		301								Pulao	I don't know how to describe it better, but I'm sure it feels very sad.	1																					
22	22		204							1																								
23	23		301									An ordinary kid of her age would probably cry even harder when comforted. But Pulao only pats her own cheeks, then puts up a forced smile.																						
24	24		301									You haven't spent a long time with her, but you already know her nature. That is why you were not trying to console her; it was more like stating a fact.																						
25	25		302								But I mean it.	26																						
26	26		302								I put a tracker on the badge.	27																						
27	27		301									The instructor at F.O.S. once told you to prepare for all possible negative outcomes.																						
28	28		301									The loss of the badge may be out of your control, but you can at least make some preparation to quickly get it back.																						
29	29		301									Always look at the big picture and do everything you can. This mindset has helped you so many times—																						
30	30		401							1	205																							
31	31		204							1	11																							
32	32		301								Pulao	Commandant... Do you often lose things?	1																					
33	33		302								Ahem...	34																						
34	34		204							1																								
35	35		301								Pulao	No ordinary person would put a tracker on their graduation badge. Who would steal such a thing? It's like turning on navigation when the destination is just one street away.	1																					
36	36		302								I really was just considering the worst outcome.	37																						
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Hmm... It's true. Commandant can always notice something I missed. Let's start tracking it right now. This time, I'll get all of them!	1

40	40		202							1	2				1																			
41	41		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Tracking the badge isn't as easy as you think. The tracker is constantly returning signals, but a Babylonia terminal does not have detailed maps of the Nighter stored.																						
42	42		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory160.png																								
43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Both you and Pulao have also tacitly avoided the solution of uploading the Nighter's map to the terminal.																						
44	44		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory158.png																								
45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					As a result, the tracker can only provide you with the approximate direction and straight distance. The street layout is quite complicated with numerous alleys running across. Without Pulao, you would probably be lost long ago.																						
46	46		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory161.png																								
47	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But after a long pursuit, even Pulao seems to have made a mistake. You see an over 10 meters tall wall in front. Even Constructs can hardly go over it. You have come to a dead end.																						
48	48		201							1	500446	12																						
49	49		301							1	Pulao	Commandant, is the target still moving?	1																					
50	50		301									You check the terminal. The answer is yes.																						
51	51		301								Pulao	How is that possible? This should be a checkmate according to my plan. There is no way out behind the wall.	1																					
52	52		302								Is he moving over the roofs?	53																						
53	53		301								Pulao	I have been monitoring those areas. I would have noticed if he is running along the roofs.	1																					
54	54		301								Pulao	Hmm... We'll have to go around it.	1																					
55	55		301								Pulao	This way, Commandant! Follow me, don't get lost.	1																					
56	56		301									After some time...																						
57	57		301								Pulao	Are you sure the target is nearby, Commandant?	1																					
58	58		301									No wonder Pulao is so confused. The terminal shows the badge should be just 10 meters ahead.																						
59	59		301									But there is nothing nearby. You search around carefully and move closer, but the familiar metal badge is nowhere to be seen.																						
60	60		301								Pulao	I can't find anything either. If your tracker is working fine, then there is only one possible explanation.	1																					
61	61		301									Pulao stares at the road surface as if she wants to see through it.																						
62	62		301								Pulao	The suspect is moving through pipes!	1																					
63	63		302								The pipes?	64																						
64	64		301								Pulao	The Nighter installed many pipes under the roads to supply the life needs of civilians.	1																					
65	65		301								Pulao	Only by moving through pipes can he ignore the obstacles on the ground.	1																					
66	66		301								Pulao	We can't see him, because he is right under us!	1																					
67	67		301								Pulao	But most pipes aren't designed for humans to pass. Only small maintenance robots can go through.	1																					
68	68		301								Pulao	Looks like my initial guess was wrong. There is only one real suspect, which is that shadow. He must be using a machine to steal things.	1																					
69	69		301								Pulao	Now I need to watch the direction of pipes. If only I can break through the ground... But no! I can't cause more troubles to the residents and Bixi Crew!	1																					
70	70		302								It is moving again.	71																						
71	71		301								Pulao	I have taken the pipe direction into account. Let's go! He won't get away this time!	1																					
72	72		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The girl's eyes are burning with passion. She dashes toward the end of the street.																						
73	73		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Pulao	Hmm, this is a great location for doing dodgy business. According to the map, there is a drain that connects to the pipe.	1																					
74	74		301									In front of you is a derelict mansion that would fit perfectly in a Golden Age horror movie. The building seems to have been abandoned for a long time. Wind shakes a broken paper lantern, leaving shredded paper and dust on the ground.																						
75	75		301								Pulao	Alrighty. I'm going in... Argh! What are you doing, Commandant! Put me down!	1																					
76	76		301									Pulao seems to have decided to break in while you are still observing the location.																						
77	77		301									If you don't stop her, the thick wooden door would break into pieces after being kicked by a Construct.																						
78	78		301									You have to raise Pulao up in the air. She can only kick her legs and twist her body in protest.																						
79	79		302								The shadow could well be inside too.	80																						
80	80		301									You lower your voice and explain to Pulao. She immediately understands and covers her mouth. Seeing that she has calmed down, you also put her down.																						
81	81		301								Pulao	What should we do then?	1																					
82	82		202							1					1																			
83	83		301									After confirming the signal is still there, you point at the wall on the side. It's quite tall, but not a problem for Constructs.																						
84	84		301									Once Pulao is up on the wall, you can easily cross over with her help. Pulao has understood your plan. She nods and walks toward the wall.																						
85	85		301									A quick leap takes Pulao up the wall with ease. Nimble as a cat, she has not made any noise. She first peeks inside the mansion and waves to you.																						
86	86		301									You then walk over and reach out your hand. To your surprise, she isn't taking it, but grabs your neck like a pet—																						
87	87		301									The world turns upside down and returns to normal again. You find yourself standing on the bricks inside the mansion. Pulao jumps off the wall. You see the pleasure of revenge on her face.																						
88	88		201							1	500446																							
89	89		301							1	Pulao	I'm a lady, Commandant. You can't treat me like a kid.	1																					
90	90		302								Sure, Lil' Pulao. No problem.	91	Sorry. My bad.	91																				
91	91		204							1	4																							
92	92		301								Pulao	Hmph!	1																					
93	93		301									Apparently unsatisfied with your answer, Pulao decides to turn her attention to the main hall instead. That's where the signal comes from.																						
94	94		202							1					1																			
95	95		301									Pulao carefully tiptoes toward the main hall. You stealthily follow behind.																						
96	96		301									The door to the main hall is long gone. You can see the inside from stairs, but due to poor lighting, some area is still covered in shadow.																						
97	97		301									You suddenly see a red shadow flashing through—																						
98	98		401							2	561																							
99	99		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
100	100		301									(Crack—)																						
101	101		301									You are about to warn Pulao, but she is acting way faster. Her stomp has crushed the bricks underneath. She reaches out for the shadow's shoulder, trying to take it down.																						
102	102		301									To your surprise, the shadow easily dodges her grasp. You hear a somewhat familiar voice.																						
103	103		301								??	Pu... lao?																						
104	104		301									She sounds uncertain and slightly surprised.																						
105	105		401						400	1	36																							
106	106		401							1	5																							
107	107		201							1	500446	11	400																					
108	108		201							2	500143		-400																					
109	109		301							1	Pulao	Yazi? What are you doing here?	1																					
110	110		301									She walks out of the shadow, still carrying her red umbrella.																						
111	111		204							1	12																							
112	112		301								Yazi	I just happened to be patrolling here. Oh, and I was trying to catch this.	2																					
113	113		301									Yazi takes out a bionic rat that has stopped functioning.																						
114	114		301								Yazi	It was a spy machine used for surveillance in the past. But this one's program logic seems to have messed up, making it behave like a real rat.	2																					
115	115		204							1	11																							
116	116		301								Pulao	Huh? Do we still have this on the ship?	1																					
117	117		301								Yazi	We got rid of them long ago. This one probably manages to get through thanks to the program error. Oh, speaking of which, this must belong to the commandant.	2																					
118	118		301									Yazi tosses over a round piece of metal. It's the badge that you have been looking for.																						
119	119		301								Yazi	The bionic rat had your badge tied to its tail. I had to wash and sterilize it because it was soaked in dirty water. Hope you don't mind.	2																					
120	120		302								I can't thank you enough.	121																						
121	121		204							1																								
122	122		301								Pulao	Have you been hunting for this rat, Yazi?	1																					
123	123		301								Yazi	Right, but it's a cunning one. Quite a few times, I could only watch it steal things from other people.	2																					
124	124		301								Pulao	Red... A head the size of an umbrella... So the ghost they've been talking about is you, Yazi...	1																					
125	125		301								Yazi	What ghost?	2																					
126	126		301									Pulao briefly explains everything to Yazi: the reminder she heard from the diner, the investigation you did today, and how you searched all the way here.																						
127	127		301								Yazi	It seems my carelessness has caused some trouble. I will pay more attention from now on.	2																					
128	128		301								Yazi	But I have another question.	2																					
129	129		301									Yazi gazes at Pulao.																						
130	130		301								Yazi	Your duty today is to protect the Babylonia guests, right? Why do I only see the commandant here? What's with your dress and this rattle drum...?	2																					
131	131		204							1	11																							
132	132		301							1	Pulao	Ah!	1																					
133	133		301									Pulao quickly hides behind you, leaving only her head out. She cannot look Yazi in the eyes.																						
134	134		301								Pulao	There is a... long story. But I have a very good reason. And... right, Commandant asked me to dress up like this. I am not slacking!	1																					
135	135		302								You explain the situation to Yazi.																							
136	136		301								Yazi	...Just like the rumors stated, the commandant of Gray Raven is indeed very...	2																					
137	137		301									Yazi pauses a little, trying to find the right word.																						
138	138		301								Yazi	Unconventional.	2																					
139	139		302								I'm flattered.	140	...	142																				
140	140		204							1	2																							
141	141	144	301								Pulao	I agree. Commandant's so good.	1																					
142	142		204							1	2																							
143	143		301								Pulao	But Commandant's suggestion really works.	1																					
144	144		204							1																								
145	145		301								Pulao	Thanks to Commandant, I learned a lot of things that I never knew... Oh right!	1																					
146	146		301									Pulao suddenly thinks of something and takes Yazi's hand.																						
147	147		301								Pulao	Yazi, you should apologize to the civilians affected. You said it was due to your ignorance. You should make up for the loss then.	1																					
148	148		301								Yazi	But... They don't seem to be eager to see me.	2																					
149	149		204							1	2																							
150	150		301								Pulao	Don't worry. They actually don't hate Dragon Children that much. Besides, I will be there with you!	1																					
151	151		301								Pulao	Maybe you will get along even better after they find out the real identity of the shadow.	1																					
152	152		301								Yazi	Okay...	2																					
153	153		204							1																								
154	154		301								Pulao	Can you come with us, Commandant? Actually, I'm still a little worried...	1																					
155	155		301								Pulao	We will do the talking ourselves. But I just feel more relieved with you around, Commandant.	1																					
156	156		301									Pulao stares at you like a kid waiting for her gift.																						
157	157		301									She says she's only "a little" worried, but her hand trembles as she holds Yazi's hand.																						
158	158		302								Sure, Lil' Pulao. No problem.	159	Of course.	162																				
159	159		204							1	4																							
160	160		301								Pulao	I said, I'm not a kid!	1																					
161	161		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Yazi	Ouch...	2																					
162	162		204							1	2																							
163	163		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Hooray!	1
