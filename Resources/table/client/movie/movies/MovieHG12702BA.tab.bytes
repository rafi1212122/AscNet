4	4		301			DialogEnable						The thrust lasts but a moment. Before you know it, you are already inside a bedroom.																						
5	5		301									The world outside is already dark save for a few stars and a half-moon hanging in the sky.																						
6	6		301									After some fumbling around, you finally turn on the room light.																						
7	7		504							0																								
8	8		301									The room does not contain too many items. You can only see one single bed, one two-level wardrobe, one desk, and one chair.																						
9	9		301									You find yourself no longer wearing the combat uniform, but a soft, casual outfit instead.																						
10	10		301									Your military terminal has been replaced with a small civilian model. Unlike Babylonia's simple style, there are a lot of fashionable, intricate patterns on this terminal.																						
11	11		302								It looks like something from the Golden Age.	12																						
12	12		301									You feel something in your ear and touch it. It is a mini earbud.																						
13	13		301									The alarm clock on the desk reads 20:00. A blue holo-screen catches your attention.																						
14	14		301									When you are about to look at it up close, you suddenly hear a cold, robotic voice in your earbud.																						
15	15		401							2	1515																							
16	16		301								Robotic Voice	System online.																						
17	17		301								Robotic Voice	Good evening, citizen 【kuroname】.																						
18	18		301									The voice sounds extremely familiar to a Babylonia resident like you.																						
19	19		301									It belongs to the super AI "Gestalt".																						
20	20		301									But it is not the real Gestalt who is talking to you. It is just one of the things that Maple is able to simulate.																						
21	21		301								"Gestalt"	First of all, happy birthday.																						
22	22		401						500	2	954																							
23	23		401						500	2	10001108																							
24	25		301									You hear brief fireworks.																						
25	26		301								"Gestalt"	According to the World Government's "Citizen Welfare Act", Chapter 3, Article 291, every citizen connected to Gestalt has the legal right to be matched to others after reaching the physical age of 18.																						
26	27		301								"Gestalt"	You are eligible for matching. Would you like to commence the process?																						
27	28		301									After the question, "Gestalt" awaits your answer in silence.																						
28	29		301									You give an answer after thinking for a very short moment.																						
29	30		302								No.	31																						
30	31		301									Nanami, who entered the virtual space with you, is nowhere to be found. Your top priority right now is to find her. From a game perspective, you need to complete the main quest first.																						
31	32		301								"Gestalt"	Understood. Terminating execution...																						
32	33		301									The cold robotic voice halts. After a short, irregular noise, "Gestalt" speaks again with a monotonous tone—																						
33	34		301								"Gestalt"	You are eligible for matching. Would you like to commence the process?																						
34	35		301								"Gestalt"	You are eligible for matching. Would you like to commence the process?																						
35	36		301								"Gestalt"	You are eligible for matching. Would you like to commence the process? You are eligible for matching. Would you like to commence the process? You are eligible for matching...																						
36	37		301									It keeps repeating the same line unemotionally.																						
37	38		302								Is this a so-called "sudden event"?	39																						
38	39		301									You recall Nanami and Maple's conversation. Gestalt will not stop hassling you, so you have to accept the match while searching for Nanami in the wardrobe, under the bed, and in the ceiling.																						
39	40		301									She likes to play hide-and-seek. You cannot rule out the possibility that she is hiding in your "spawn point."																						
40	41		301								"Gestalt"	Permission granted. Matching citizen 【kuroname】 with other applicable targets...																						
41	42		301								"Gestalt"	Matching completed. Thank you for your support. I wish the two of you a good time.																						
42	43		301								"Gestalt"	Logging off.																						
43	44		301									The moment your communication with "Gestalt" ends, you hear an energetic voice—																						
44	45		401							1	204																							
45	46		301							1	"Naive Voice"	Hulo!	1																					
46	47		301									She sounds so excited that her voice is trembling.																						
47	48		302								Hello.	49																						
48	49		301								"Naive Voice"	This is my first time matching with someone... But you sound calm and reliable. You must have done this many times.	1																					
49	50		302								Not really...	51																						
50	51		301								"Naive Voice"	What? Is this your first time too? Fate has brought us together!	1																					
51	52		301								"Naive Voice"	Do you like animals? My favorite is our dog. My parents and I call it "Mimi". Isn't it a great name...	1																					
52	53		301									The girl keeps talking about her hobbies, leaving no time for you to speak. As she introduces herself, you begin to paint a picture of her in your mind.																						
53	54		301									You still do not know her name or age. She is the only child in the family, currently living with her parents.																						
54	55		301									She goes to the high school nearby and has slightly above-average grades. She is currently concerned about how to build an 18-meter tall "Generic Humanoid Battle Weapon".																						
55	56		301									She never stays up late and sleeps at the same time every day. Before going to bed, she puts on a piece of performance-boosting equipment she made that consumes a liter of jet fuel to run around the highway with Mimi. Then, she sleeps after some stretching until her mother wakes her up.																						
56	57		301									She is always adventurous, very competitive but not troubled by the results. Her favorite anime is "Masked Motorcycle Rider".																						
57	58		301									An ordinary girl who claims to be hyperactive.																						
58	59		302								...	60																						
59	60		301									You feel like you have some clues on Nanami's whereabouts.																						
60	61		301								"Naive Voice"	Oh, right. I haven't asked you your name.	1																					
61	62		301								"Naive Voice"	Can you tell me your name?	1																					
62	63		302								【kuroname】.	64																						
63	64		301								"Naive Voice"	【kuroname】... 【kuroname】, hmm...	1																					
64	65		401							2	1515																							
65	66		301									You suddenly receive a communication request in the terminal.																						
66	67		302								(Answer)	68																						
67	68		301								Nanami	Hello, 【kuroname】. My name is Nanami.	1

72	73		301							1		The hologram turns into a girl who looks identical to Nanami, but without the Inver-Device on her head or the giant chainsaw that she often holds.																						
73	74		301									If you ignore the unbelievable self-introduction, she looks just like an ordinary girl who lives next door, anxiously looking forward to the unknown encounter.																						
74	75		301									She crosses her hands on her chest and takes a deep breath in, then reaches out her right hand as if she is opening up her heart.																						
75	76		301								"Background Narration"	"Who doesn't long for love in their youth?"																						
76	77		301								"Background Narration"	"You wrote to your friend, describing your first encounter with the girl: I feel like a ship approaching a mountain of magnets. Even my tiniest screw is attracted to her."																						
77	78		301									Your vision is filled with the girl before you as you are pulled closer to her.

103	104		301								Nanami	【kuroname】, no!																						
104	105		301									The girl is in tears. Her hands remain in the same gesture without touching anything. She is no longer a that shy and naive little child.																						
105	106		301									She is screaming and struggling, trying to grasp the life and memories that are about to disappear.																						
106	107		301									Before you realize it, you are holding a handgun. Its cold muzzle is pressing against your temple. The smell of gun smoke hints at imminent death...

133	134		301									They have the fragrance of flowers and fresh grass.																						
134	135		301									Then she presses harder on your cheeks. Her palms are also sticking to your cheeks—
