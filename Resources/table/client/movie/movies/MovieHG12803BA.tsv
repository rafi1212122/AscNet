4	4		401							1	208																							
5	5		301									It is a small pathway hiding between the collapsed buildings.																						
6	6		301									Overlapping debris covers the area above you, one filling the gap of the other.																						
7	7		301									Occasionally, light shines through the cracks, giving your journey sudden bursts of brightness.

9	9		301							1	Haicma	...	1																					
10	10		302								...																							
11	11		301									One after another, the two of you walk onward.																						
12	12		301								Haicma	I've detected that our paths have overlapped for over 30 minutes. May I ask if I can interpret your action as tracking me?	1																					
13	13		302								...	14	(That's the seventh time she asked.)	14																				
14	14		302								We just happen to be heading the same way. I can walk ahead if you want?	15																						
15	15		301								Haicma	...	1																					
16	16		301									She does not slow down. After all, with her more advanced visual module, it is more reasonable for her to lead the way.																						
17	17		301									But this is the "Scavenger's Path", which the scouting team called a "communication hell."																						
18	18		301									You are just installing motion sensors around the conservation area. There is no need for you to be out in the open.																						
19	19		301									So you followed Babylonia's suggestions and traveled on this long corridor alone after the other Gray Ravens were sent to assist short-staffed teams.																						
20	20		301									But you did not expect to run into Haicma. Is she on a special mission where she has to stay hidden? That makes it inappropriate for you to ask her.																						
21	21		302								Do the people from the conservation area still distrust the reinforcement from Babylonia?	22																						
22	22		301								Haicma	Trust requires proof. It has to be built upon the foundation of logic and rationality...	1																					
23	23		401							1	36																							
24	24		301									She suddenly stops talking, her eyes focusing on an unremarkable corner.																						
25	25		301									Walking toward there, she kneels down.																						
26	26		401							1	207																							
27	27		301									It is a lily buried in the ruins.																						
28	28		301									Sustained only by a gleam of sunlight through the cracks, it is on the verge of dying.																						
29	29		301									You can hardly describe the flower as sprouting. Every second that wearied plant lives is a mercy from the grim reaper.																						
30	30		301									In this gray and dark world, the rubbles build a stage where the dying performer stands in the spotlight, playing the last act of its life.																						
31	31		301									The surrounding ruins are waiting for its curtain call so that they may devour its stubborn figure.																						
32	32		301								Haicma	...	1																					
33	33		301									After a short silence, Haicma suddenly stands up.																						
34	34		204							1	10																							
35	35		301								Haicma	It's too late.	1																					
36	36		301									Her pitiful whisper sounds like a sentence.																						
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		301								Haicma	There is no feasible way to save it.	1																					
39	39		301									How come?																						
40	40		302								(Inspect)	41																						
41	41		301									The roots are not rotten, and there are no signs of pest infestation. The lily is not looking good, but it is not beyond salvageable.																						
42	42		301								Haicma	The stem and leaves are heavily damaged, and there isn't enough water in the soil.	1																					
43	43		301								Haicma	It can't survive being repotted, and this isn't a habitable environment. It won't live long, according to my calculations.	1																					
44	44		401							1	36																							
45	45		302								...	46																						
46	46		302								(Take out your flask)	47																						
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		401							1	208																							
49	49		301									Shaking the flask, you compare the water level to the volume marker and estimate there should be 300 ml of clean, drinkable water remaining.																						
50	50		301									Then you take out the protective film that was wrapping around your testing device and roll it into a ring.																						
51	51		301									If you can take care of the temperature and the water source...																						
52	52		301									You look up where the sun is seeping through, making sure the surrounding area is "modifiable."																						
53	53		301									Standing on a fallen column, you take out a glowstick, breaking one end to pour the fluorescent liquid onto the tip of your combat knife.																						
54	54		301									Looking at the angle the sun is shining through and taking the changes of day and night into account, you determine the required area and mark it with your knife.																						
55	55		301									You have explosives on you, but they will not do here as the shockwave alone will destroy the fragile plant.																						
56	56		301									Ignoring how the bullets will ricochet in the enclosed space, you still cannot put an accurate hole through concrete and steel bars with your pistol.																						
57	57		301									And forget about your army knife. By the time you finish digging a hole, new flowers will probably have sprouted.																						
58	58		401							1	36																							
59	59		301									At the end of the day, you alone cannot solve the problem with the sunlight.																						
60	60		201							1	500486																							
61	61		301							1	Haicma	Even with everything you've done, the chance of this lily living long enough to bloom is lower than 1%.	1																					
62	62		302								Indeed.	63																						
63	63		401							1	50																							
64	64		301									Rain, storms, pests, collapsing ruins, hungry wild beasts...																						
65	65		301									Even a brush from a Scavenger's cloak can kill this lily with ease.																						
66	66		302								But it is still trying.	67																						
67	67		302								It is reaching for the sun as if hoping for a miracle.	68																						
68	68		301								Haicma	A miracle... a less-than-1% chance... I don't see its value.	1																					
69	69		302								Perhaps it won't turn out the way you expected.	70																						
70	70		302								But if you don't try and hold onto something, miracles will never happen.	71																						
71	71		301									You tap the spot you marked on the wall.																						
72	72		302								I could use your help here, Haicma.	73																						
73	73		204							1	10																							
74	74		301								Haicma	...Request declined.	1																					
75	75		302								Haicma...	76																						
76	76		204							1																								
77	77		301								Haicma	The protrusion at 4 o'clock has a chance to cause the innermost panel on the right to collapse. Your request is partially declined.	1																					
78	78		301								Haicma	Please watch yourself.	1																					
79	79		302								(You got it!)	80

85	85		301									The shriek from her blade grinding the stone wall is quickly drowned out by the sound of heavy rubbles crashing to the ground.																						
86	86		301									Sweeping away the dust flying before you, you find yourself enveloped by sunlight.																						
87	87		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStorySandNew.prefab																							
88	88		302								(It's super effective!)	89																						
89	89		301								Haicma	Will that do?	1																					
90	90		302								Yes. Thank you, Haicma.	91																						
91	91		301									You block the sunlight with one arm and tear away the dust-covered protective film with another.																						
92	92		301									Your eyes are still adjusting to the brightness, but you breathe a sigh of relief once you see the shape of a frail but standing sprout.																						
93	93		401							1	36																							
94	94		301								Haicma	...	1																					
95	95		301									Standing among the falling debris, Haicma observes the broken world from the opening she created.																						
96	96		301									Undoubtedly, leaving the "Scavenger's Path" will lead to even more dire scenarios.																						
97	97		301									Miracles cannot sustain anywhere.																						
98	98		301									This plant has a more than 99% chance of dying in, presumably, over 200 different ways.																						
99	99		301									The moment Haicma's visual sensor captures it, her processor will calculate and present her with its endings in a much more realistic way.																						
100	100		301									Machines... do not make mistakes...																						
101	101		301									So she turns around, looking at the lily once more. But she finds something completely different this time.																						
102	102		401							1	204																							
103	103		301									The gentle breeze is holding the drooping bud up, and the sunlight slowly gathers around the flower after casting away the darkness.																						
104	104		301									Beautiful, dignified, pure... None of these words actually match the appearance of the plant before her—																						
105	105		301									And yet, the image of it blooming overlaps with reality somehow.																						
106	106		301									It sways in the wind with its petals blossoming, bathing in the sunlight like how the lilies look in the database.																						
107	107		301								Haicma	...	1																					
108	108		301								Haicma	The water on the second film layer is dripping into the soil excessively.	1																					
109	109		301									According to her observation, one of the sides has simply collapsed, leading to the slight excess. All it requires is a small adjustment...																						
110	110		301								Haicma	Adjustment complete.	1																					
111	111		302								Thanks, Haicma. That will do it.	112																						
112	112		202							1					1																			
113	113		301									0.0714%... 0.0717%... 0.07184%... The number... is climbing?																						
114	114		301									With your every act, the lily's survival rate increases ever so slightly.																						
115	115		301									Still, the increase is just a drop in the bucket.																						
116	116		301									It never exceeds 0.08% before the two of you depart.																						
117	117		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But it is inching closer to the chance of the two of you meeting again.																						
118	118		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory303.png																								
119	119		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						At night, the city without light goes silent. Haicma sits alone before her drawing board.																						
120	120		301									She has long contemplated what should be placed on the canvas to fill its empty space in the center. She even asked the one who claimed to be the best artist ever, but no useful suggestions were given.																						
121	121		301									There, two pairs of hands are holding a stem.																						
122	122		301									But Haicma is not sure what to paint on top of the stem.																						
123	123		301									"What does the lily look like in your vision?"

126	126		204							1	10																							
127	127		301									Her pen pressing against the paper, Haicma slowly closes her eyes...																						
128	128		301									At dawn, the first ray of sunlight goes through the window and sneaks inside.																						
129	129		301									After they travel around the room and light up the space, they all gather around one painting.																						
130	130		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					At the center of it, a blossoming white lily glistens in the morning light.
