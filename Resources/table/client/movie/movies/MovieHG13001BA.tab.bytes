5	5		301							1		As usual, Noan is half an hour early to Dark Aries' preparation room, waiting for the regular meeting with Simon and the other two teammates.																						
6	6		301									It has been almost a month since Noan came to Babylonia. He is slowly getting used to life here.																						
7	7		301									Each day has become longer. As a Construct, he no longer needs to sleep every day.																						
8	8		301									Apart from the routine training and occasional frame checks, he has no fixed schedule.																						
9	9		301									He wanted to stay in the training room a little longer, but as long as he was there, others would stay away.																						
10	10		301									In the end, Noan would take up the entire room, while the rest would squeeze inside another.																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He asked Commandant Simon and Captain Palma for advice...

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Simon	...The information about your frame and Ascendants should be classified, unless someone purposely leaked it.	1																					
16	16		301								Palma	Tch, even if no one leaked it, I don't think you will ever blend in with those "normal" guys.	2																					
17	17		202							2					1																			
18	18		201							1	500506																							
19	19		301							1	Noan	Why?	1																					
20	20		201							1	500522																							
21	21		301							1	Palma	Do you know what others call the restructured Dark Aries?	1																					
22	22		301								Palma	"Black Sheep", or "Outcast". Three of us all have our own problems. Lillian may not look like one, but she is in fact...	1																					
23	23		201							1	500335																							
24	24		301							1	Lillian	Captain Palma...!	1																					
25	25		201							1	500522																							
26	26		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Palma	Anyway, just forget about making friends.	1

29	29		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		There is a subtle grief in her words. She sounds like she is trying to persuade herself.																						
30	30		301									Recently, Noan often saw others board the shuttle in a rush for missions on the surface.																						
31	31		301									Even Gray Raven, who had just returned, also immediately moved on to the next mission.																						
32	32		301									Apart from Dark Aries, everyone is busy.																						
33	33		301									Each time he asked Commandant Simon when he could take part in a mission, he was always answered with "We are still in maintenance."																						
34	34		301									—When can I ever go help the frontline?																						
35	35		301									—Or, am I already being "helpful" by not causing any more trouble?																						
36	36		301								Noan	...	1																					
37	37		301									Not only in the training room, he can feel others looking at him or whispering when he walks on the road.																						
38	38		301									Noan knows they have no ill intentions, nor will they reject him. But their overly polite attitude makes him feel somehow alienated.																						
39	39		301									It is always reminding him that he is an outsider with too much affiliation with Ascendants. That they need to beware of him.																						
40	40		301								Noan	...	1																					
41	41		301								Noan	It is but one of the prices I have to pay for my choice.	1																					
42	42		301									He just silently tells himself that he should not feel bitter about it.

45	45		201							2	500506		400																					
46	46		301							1	Simon	Noan? You're the first again.	1																					
47	47		301								Noan	Right. I don't really have anything else to do.	2																					
48	48		301								Simon	Is it still the same... in the training room?	1																					
49	49		301								Noan	Yeah. I think I should go when there aren't many people around.	2																					
50	50		301									Simon lowers his head and remains silent for a long time.																						
51	51		301								Simon	I met the Chief on the way here.	1																					
52	52		301								Simon	They just returned from a mission, but will soon take part in a new one. I heard that another more dangerous, large-scale mission would commence in just a month's time.	1																					
53	53		301									Noan has not answered Simon. He just listens quietly.																						
54	54		301									He is always like this. When he does not know what to say, he would start talking about Gray Raven Commandant.																						
55	55		301									Probably because it is the safest common topic, compared with the past of Dark Aries, his own attitude toward Noan, or anything related to Noan's recent situation.																						
56	56		301									In such a conversation, Simon won't leak anything that he shouldn't say, nor will he fall into bitter memories after bringing up Dark Aries' past.																						
57	57		301								Simon	...	1																					
58	58		301									But he is not continuing on the topic today.																						
59	59		301								Simon	Right, if you have nothing to do, shall we go for a walk in the square nearby?	1																					
60	60		301								Simon	The greenhouse in the outer section of F.O.S. College has been open to public since half a year ago. Some of the species are hardly found even on the surface.	1																					
61	61		301								Simon	Oh, and the library in Zone K...	1																					
62	62		301								Simon	Now that everybody uses their terminal to find information, the library is almost always empty. They renovated it three years ago and put it next to the cafe, but there are still not many visitors.	1																					
63	63		301								Noan	Sure. I'll check it out.	2																					
64	64		301								Noan	But... Did something happen?	2																					
65	65		301								Simon	Um... What?	1																					
66	66		301								Noan	Between you and the Chief?	2																					
67	67		301								Simon	...Nothing.	1																					
68	68		301								Noan	Then why aren't you talking about the Chief today?	2																					
69	69		301								Simon	...You really are sensitive.	1																					
70	70		301								Simon	I didn't continue on the topic because it could be just my personal opinion.	1																					
71	71		301									Simon thinks for a while, rubbing his fingers.																						
72	72		301								Simon	When I met Chief today, I felt like that person was already on the edge...	1																					
73	73		301								Noan	On the edge?	2																					
74	74		301								Simon	It could be that I'm just thinking too much.	1																					
75	75		301									He emphasizes again.																						
76	76		301								Simon	Still, it looked like Chief hadn't had a good rest for ages.	1																					
77	77		301								Noan	But didn't that commandant just return from a mission?	2																					
78	78		301								Simon	Correct. I checked the task allocation, Gray Raven wasn't given that much work, but they were always busy in Babylonia...	1																					
79	79		301								Simon	I don't know if Chief is just trying to stay busy... on purpose?	1																					
80	80		301								Simon	Sigh. I'm probably thinking too much.	1																					
81	81		301								Noan	But there must be a reason to make you think so, right?	2																					
82	82		301								Simon	...That's right.	1																					
83	83		301								Simon	Chief had brain injuries during the operation in Pulia Forest Park Ruins, and had been in coma for about three months.	1																					
84	84		301								Noan	Yeah, I know that.	2																					
85	85		301								Simon	When Chief woke up, the world was devastated. Numerous people had died. Even Chief's most reliable team member was on the brink of death...	1																					
86	86		301								Simon	If it was me, I would probably hate myself for sleeping so long.	1																					
87	87		301								Noan	...	2																					
88	88		301								Simon	After saving Liv, Chief fell unconscious again.	1																					
89	89		301								Simon	The next time Chief woke up, a lot of things had gone even worse... There were many traitors. Liv's treatment was postponed. Even Lee...	1																					
90	90		301								Simon	Bianca was also seriously wounded when she was away from Gray Raven on a mission to hunt the traitors.	1																					
91	91		301									Simon lowers his head and sighs.																						
92	92		301								Simon	Bringing you back might be one of the few pieces of good news during this time.	1																					
93	93		301								Simon	Ever since that, Chief had been trying to stay busy...	1																					
94	94		301								Noan	If you are that worried, why don't you go and ask in person?	2																					
95	95		301								Simon	Forget it...	1																					
96	96		301								Simon	I better stop thinking about it. That person is our idol and hero. Worrying too much means I don't have faith in Chief and would only add more burden.	1																					
97	97		301								Noan	...	2																					
98	98		301									But heroes are still humans. When they are hurt, they would want to cry too... Noan only keeps these words to himself.																						
99	99		301									He does not know Simon well, let alone Gray Raven Commandant. To that "Chief", he is nothing more than an acquittance. He has no right to question Simon's trust or to worry about that Chief's tenacity.																						
100	100		301								Simon	Anyway, would you like to think about my suggestion?	1																					
101	101		301								Simon	I can apply for a permit for you. You can even stay there as a temporary staff. At least you can get paid and buy something you like. Better than not knowing where to go.	1																					
102	102		204							2	1																							
103	103		301								Noan	To the greenhouse and library? Sure, thanks.	2																					
104	104		301								Simon	No problem. This is one of the few things I can help you with. I just think that someone like you... will be happier in the crowd.	1																					
105	105		301								Noan	You have already helped me a lot.	2																					
106	106		301								Simon	No... If you were assigned to Strike Hawk or another less isolated squad, you will be much better off...	1																					
107	107		301								Noan	This place is good enough for me.	2																					
108	108		301								Noan	No matter who I am, no matter where I go, I need to take one step at a time.	2																					
109	109		301								Noan	There will always be people like you who are willing to talk to me, and people like Captain Palma who would stay alerted.	2																					
110	110		204							2	2																							
111	111		301									Noan is more or less aware that Simon was also assigned to keep an eye on him, but he still lets down the guard and closes his eyes.																						
112	112		204							2																								
113	113		301								Noan	Even if I went to the squad you mentioned, the same thing would happen.	2																					
114	114		301								Noan	They need time to know and trust me. I need time to blend in. It's very fair.	2																					
115	115		301								Simon	...Fair?	1																					
116	116		301								Noan	Yeah. That's why this place is good enough for me.	2																					
117	117		301								Simon	...	1																					
118	118		401							2	1513																							
119	119		301									Simon takes off his glasses and rubs his nose. Both remain silent until it is two minutes past the scheduled meeting time. They hear the rushed steps of the other two members.

122	122		301							1	Palma	Why are you here first again? Don't you have better things to do every day?	1

124	124		301							1	Noan	Yeah, you're right.	1

126	126		301							1	Palma	I'm not complimenting you. When someone disapproves of you, just show the negative emotion instead of giving me that disgusting smile.	1

131	131		301								Palma	None of your business.	2																					
132	132		301								Simon	Palma, you promised me yesterday that you would give me bottom-line cooperation. I also agreed with the conditions you proposed.	1																					
133	133		301								Palma	...	2																					
134	134		301								Palma	Tch, I met a good opponent during the simulation battle.	2																					
135	135		301								Simon	What about you, Lillian?	1

137	137		201							2	500335		-400																					
138	138		301							1	Lillian	...I bumped into the Gray Raven Commandant outside.	2																					
139	139		301								Simon	Chief?	1																					
140	140		301								Lillian	Yeah, but then something that needed immediate handling came up, so I was asked to pass this on to you.	2																					
141	141		301									Lillian hands over a bottle of stomach pills. It looks no different from what Simon always takes.																						
142	142		301								Lillian	You are running low on pills, aren't you?	2																					
143	143		301									Simon nods and takes the bottle.

145	145		201							2	500522		-400																					
146	146		301							1	Palma	That commandant must be very free to help you get the pills.	2																					
147	147		301									Simon hears her and frowns.																						
148	148		301								Simon	Chief should be pretty busy lately.	1

152	152		301								Simon	...I see. Glad to know Chief wasn't trying too hard.	1																					
153	153		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He lets out a sigh of relief.
