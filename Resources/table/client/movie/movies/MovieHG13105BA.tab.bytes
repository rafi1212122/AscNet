4	4		301									No amount of shallow knowledge acquired through various means can ever come together to form a complete and accurate picture of this place.																						
5	5		301									One needs to actually set foot in this pure white world to feel just how small they are.

10	9		301									A week has passed since you came here with Bianca.																						
11	10		301									At the research station's dorm, two people are supposed to share one room. To help save space, you've been assigned to stay in the same room with Bianca with her permission.																						
12	11		301									As non-staff personnel, the two of you can only be assigned regular tasks by the Expedition Team.																						
13	12		301									Since most of their members are occupied with repairing the Lanternlighter, this kind of routine maintenance work can use an extra hand.																						
14	13		301									Monitoring the atmospheric data at specific locations, setting up markers for the expected delivery from the Engineering Force, and doing simple ecological documentation... Straightforward, but important nonetheless.																						
15	14		301									Not to mention that these simple tasks are challenging enough for those without any experience in scientific expeditions.																						
16	15		301									In a way, they are even more tiring than commanding Constructs on a battlefield.																						
17	16		201							1	500533																							
18	17		301							1	Bianca	Time to wake up, Commandant.	1																					
19	18		301									Hoping to catch a few more minutes of sleep, you rest your arm above your eyes, unwilling to get up. Bianca leans forward, slightly defeated, and shakes your arm.																						
20	19		204							1	5																							
21	20		301								Bianca	We'll have to eat breakfast in the vehicle again if you don't get up soon.	1																					
22	21		302								Give me a second...	22																						
23	22		301									As the continent with the highest average altitude, this place is torturing any newcomer with freezing cold and the threat of altitude sickness.																						
24	23		301									You might be in excellent shape physically, but adjusting to the pace of life here in such a short period has still proved to be a challenge.																						
25	24		301								Bianca	Commandant, weren't you the one who agreed to help the Expedition Team passionately in the first place?	1																					
26	25		204							1																								
27	26		301								Bianca	They trust us unreservedly. We ought to complete these tasks with flying colors.	1																					
28	27		301									Bianca says seriously before shifting to a gentler tone.																						
29	28		204							1	3																							
30	29		301								Bianca	But we can rest inside today if you aren't feeling well.	1																					
31	30		204							1	2																							
32	31		301								Bianca	I'll complete our assignment today as planned by myself.	1																					
33	32		302								Don't. I'm getting up.	33																						
34	33		301									You are still an experienced commandant, after all. You cannot begin to imagine the shame you will bring to F.O.S. and the Task Force if you give in because you cannot acclimate to the cold.

40	39		301			DialogEnable						Deftly crawling out of your bed, you quickly clean up before enjoying the breakfast Bianca has prepared for you. You two board the expedition vehicle afterward, heading toward your destination of the day.																						
41	40		302								What are the others doing today?	41																						
42	41		201							1	500533																							
43	42		301							1	Bianca	Most of the Engineering Force is still repairing the icebreaker, while most of the Expedition Team is planning to collect meteorites.																						
44	43		302								Meteorites?	44																						
45	44		301								Bianca	That's right. Meteor showers happen quite frequently in Antarctica, making this region a rich reserve of meteorites.	1																					
46	45		301								Bianca	Before humans could travel to the stars, collecting meteorites in Antarctica was the simplest and cheapest way to acquire materials from outer space.	1																					
47	46		301								Bianca	It was said that people on this continent had observed molecular activities of giant meteor explosions from hundreds of thousands of years ago...	1																					
48	47		204							1	1																							
49	48		301								Bianca	It might not appear so, but this place has a unique bond with the universe, doesn't it?	1																					
50	49		301									Although this is only a temporary assignment, Bianca has been studying for the past few days. Unbeknown to you, her knowledge of Antarctica has far exceeded what you can imagine.																						
51	50		301									Even the Expedition Team is amazed by how quickly she has been learning. Perhaps it is because she was already curious about this place, to begin with.																						
52	51		302								I seem to remember that some people even claimed aliens established a base here.	52																						
53	52		204							1																								
54	53		301								Bianca	Indeed. There have been rumors like that ever since Antarctica was discovered.	1																					
55	54		301								Bianca	But humans had conducted large-scale scans on the Arctic and Antarctica with polar satellites back in the Golden Age. No extraterrestrial lives were discovered.	1																					
56	55		301								Bianca	I suppose it's reasonable to say that you can only find them in science fiction and movies.	1																					
57	56		302								It'd be quite interesting if we ran into some aliens, wouldn't it?	57																						
58	57		204							1	3																							
59	58		301								Bianca	"Interesting" wouldn't suffice if we did.	1																					
60	59		204							1																								
61	60		301								Bianca	If there were aliens on this planet... it would upend everything humans knew about the world, just like what the Punishing Virus did.	1																					
62	61		301								Bianca	That said, some in the Expedition Team are still pretty obsessed with legends like that.	1																					
63	62		204							1	4																							
64	63		301								Bianca	Who knows? Maybe they will discover something one day.	1																					
65	64		301									Even such nonsensical tales will prompt sincere and serious replies from Bianca.																						
66	65		204							1	1																							
67	66		301									Removed from her role in the Purifying Force, Bianca's respectful attitude has won her the Expedition Team's affection over the last few days, her repute surpassing even you, the "legendary commandant."																						
68	67		301									Unsurprisingly, everyone is more than happy to share their stories with her.																						
69	68		301									You are glad to see it, despite your slightest hint of frustration.																						
70	69		301								Bianca	I think we should focus on observing the creatures that actually exist in Antarctica today.	1																					
71	70		302								You mean...	71																						
72	71		301									You know the answer before she can say anything.																						
73	72		301									There is one and only one creature that jumps into people's minds regarding Antarctica.																						
74	73		301									The black-and-white birds walk along the snow-covered shores, their short and stout figures swaying from side to side.																						
75	74		301									Occasionally they will lie down and spread their tiny wings, gliding freely on the frozen ground.																						
76	75		302								Those are real penguins...	76																						
77	76		301									Your eyes wide and your face stuck to the window, you cannot keep your eyes away from the small, cuddly creatures before the expedition vehicle even gets close.																						
78	77		204							1	7																							
79	78		301								Bianca	What's wrong, Commandant? Did you get snow in your eyes?	1																					
80	79		301									Seeing something sparkling in your eyes while you hold your camera, Bianca asks you concernedly after getting out of the car.																						
81	80		302								No, it's nothing...	81																						
82	81		204							1																								
83	82		301									When Babylonia has to grow its various plant samples behind closed doors in a secured, monitored greenhouse, "zoos" are impossible for the space station despite how common they were in the Golden Age.																						
84	83		301									People nowadays learn about penguins only through holograms and infographics.																						
85	84		301									But witnessing the "natives" of Antarctica, the creatures who have lived here since millions of years ago, with their own eyes is a privilege only available to a few dozen people.																						
86	85		301									You are also feeling a little hint of jealousy.																						
87	86		301									Only here, where human civilizations could not reach, was spared by the Punishing Virus.																						
88	87		301									And so, the penguins' lives have not changed because of it.																						
89	88		301									Most people should not need to confront a world-ending event in their lives. Now, all they can do is find comfort in these worry-free birds.																						
90	89		301								Bianca	Their shapes seem to suggest that they are emperor penguins, the largest penguins in Antarctica.	1																					
91	90		301								Bianca	It is breeding season for emperor penguins right now. The male penguins are in charge of hatching the eggs while the female ones migrate to a different water body to search for food for their community.	1																					
92	91		301								Bianca	We can't disturb them. That has been a rule since the Antarctic Treaty was signed.	1																					
93	92		301								Bianca	But we still need to record their migration in its entirety.	1																					
94	93		204							1	1																							
95	94		301								Bianca	It is valuable data when we look into how the ecosystem of Antarctica has changed.	1																					
96	95		302								Let's get closer, then. Is that okay?	96																						
97	96		204							1	3																							
98	97		301								Bianca	It's fine... I think. Penguins don't have natural predators on land, and they aren't afraid of humans.	1																					
99	98		204							1	1																							
100	99		301								Bianca	They might just mistake us as larger penguins if anything.	1																					
101	100		301								Bianca	They seem to be resting now. Let's approach quietly, Commandant.	1																					
102	101		302								I'll hold the camera.	102																						
103	102		301									Treading lightly, Bianca and you slowly advance toward the penguins.																						
104	103		301									But right as you arrive at the optimal recording distance, something snaps loudly beside you.																						
105	104		204							1	7																							
106	105		301									Bianca's leg armor has smashed a piece of ice. Her new frame might have been installed with the most advanced sound-absorbing material for her covert operations, but thin ice seems to be beyond its purview.																						
107	106		204							1	8																							
108	107		301									Being the one who suggested approaching quietly in the first place, Bianca now looks a little abashed.																						
109	108		301								Bianca	I'm sorry, Commandant. I screwed up...	1																					
110	109		204							1	5																							
111	110		301									Several penguins have noticed the commotion here. Surprisingly, they make their way toward you instead of scrambling away.																						
112	111		301									Four to five penguins eventually gather around Bianca, watching curiously at the navy blue figure before them with their inky black eyes.																						
113	112		301								Bianca	Commandant... what should I do?	1																					
114	113		301									Bianca is more alarmed by the animals' affections than worried about hurting them, having removed most of her weapons before leaving the vehicle.																						
115	114		302								I think they're treating you as one of them.	115	Hello, "Penguin Bianca".	117																				
116	115		204							1	6																							
117	116	119	301								Bianca	Now's not the time to tease others, Commandant.	1																					
118	117		204							1	6																							
119	118		301								Bianca	It's not a good habit to give other people nicknames, Commandant.	1																					
120	119		301									Bianca looks at you resignedly.																						
121	120		302								This isn't too bad, is it?	121	We can take clearer photos this way.	123																				
122	121		204							1	3																							
123	122	125	301								Bianca	...If you say so.	1																					
124	123		204							1	3																							
125	124		301								Bianca	...Won't argue with you.	1																					
126	125		204							1																								
127	126		301								Bianca	Still, I was expecting them to be scared of me...	1																					
128	127		302								I guess animals have better instincts.	129																						
129	128		204							1	1																							
130	129		301								Bianca	If that's the case, you're no different to the penguins, Commandant, having been by my side all this time.	1																					
131	130		301								Bianca	Should I start calling you "Penguin Commandant" as well?	1																					
132	131		301									...You did not expect retribution to be so swift.																						
133	132		302								Right.	133																						
134	133		302								Do you want to take a group photo with the penguins on this rare occasion?	134																						
135	134		204							1	7																							
136	135		301								Bianca	A group photo?	1																					
137	136		301									Your camera might be intended for scientific observation, but the Expedition Team has mentioned that you are free to take photos of interesting things and views on your journey. They often do that as well.																						
138	137		301									You cannot imagine them being stationed here for decades at a time without indulging themselves like this otherwise.																						
139	138		302								A photo or two should be fine.	139																						
140	139		204						600	1	8																							
141	140		204							1	1																							
142	141		301								Bianca	...I see.	1																					
143	142		301									Bianca thinks for a moment before nodding.																						
144	143		301									You were expecting her to reject you, so you are surprised to find her agreeing so quickly.																						
145	144		301								Bianca	Thank you, then, Commandant.	1																					
146	145		301									She carefully crouches down to be in the frame with the penguins.																						
147	146		301									The penguins all stare at Bianca curiously while she is captivated by their every move. Slowly she reaches out with a finger, only to retract it right before she touches their furry skin.																						
148	147		301									Right at that moment, one of the penguins suddenly opens its beak and bites down on Bianca's finger.																						
149	148		301									Bianca's frame is undamaged by a penguin's bite, obviously. Upon realizing that it has bitten something harder than a rock, the penguin tilts its head, surprised and confused.																						
150	149		301								Bianca	Pfft...	1																					
151	150		301									Even Bianca cannot help but laugh upon seeing this.																						
152	151		301									Meanwhile, you take advantage of this rare opportunityâ€”																						
153	152		302								Look at the camera, Bianca.	153																						
154	153		204							1	7																							
155	154		301								Bianca	Huh?	1																					
156	155		301									â€”Right as she looks up at you, but before her genuine smile goes awayâ€”																						
157	156		401							2	925

159	158		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory216.png																								
160	159		301									"Click!" You press the shutter decisively.																						
161	160		302								Photo's taken.	161																						
162	161		301									Bianca does not know how to react, having been "ambushed" by you. When she comes to her senses, she finds herself inspecting the photo you took.																						
163	162		204							1	5																							
164	163		301								Bianca	Commandant... shouldn't there be a countdown before you take a photo?	1																					
165	164		302								It looks better this way.	165																						
166	165		204							1	2																							
167	166		301								Bianca	Hand me the camera, Commandant.	1																					
168	167		301									Bianca stands up and reaches out to you, smiling.																						
169	168		301									You can tell that this smile harbors the polar opposite of how she was feeling with the penguins.																						
170	169		302								It'd be a shame if you deleted it.	170																						
171	170		204							1																								
172	171		301								Bianca	I wasn't intending to.	1																					
173	172		301								Bianca	I just thought you'd also want to take a photo with the penguins, too, wouldn't you, Commandant?	1																					
174	173		204							1	1																							
175	174		301								Bianca	It doesn't feel right if I'm the only person who gets to do that.	1																					
176	175		302								I do, as a matter of fact.	176																						
177	176		301									Prompted by her suggestion, you hand your camera to Bianca, and you can feel your body getting warmer from the excitement.																						
178	177		202							1																								
179	178		301									But right as you take your first step toward the penguinsâ€”																						
180	179		301								Penguins	Kaw-kawâ€”kawâ€”kaw-kawâ€”																						
181	180		301									The penguins begin to make their way back to their flock, their swaying footsteps heading away from Bianca. One of them even trips and falls from running too quickly.																						
182	181		302								...	182																						
183	182		301									Almost as if they are desperate to run away, seeing you approach.																						
184	183		201							1	500533	4																						
185	184		301							1	Bianca	Heh...	1																					
186	185		301									For a brief moment, you manage to catch Bianca's reaction with the corner of your eyesâ€”covering her mouth with her hand, she is giggling.																						
187	186		204							1																								
188	187		301									But her demeanor returns to normal once you turn around and look at her.																						
189	188		301								Bianca	I'm sorry, Commandant. I think the penguins dislike you.	1																					
190	189		301									She sounds so serious that you cannot tell if she is trying to comfort you or tease you.																						
191	190		302								I don't think penguins are that cute anymore.	191	...I didn't really want to take the photo anyway.	193																				
192	191		204							1	1																							
193	192	195	301								Bianca	(Chuckles) You are not mad at the penguins, are you?	1																					
194	193		204							1	1																							
195	194		301								Bianca	Next time, perhaps.	1																					
196	195		204							1																								
197	196		301								Bianca	Let's hurry up and capture the photos required. We shouldn't delay the mission for too long.	1																					
198	197		301								Bianca	The penguins seem to be finishing their rest as well.	1																					
199	198		202							1																								
200	199		301									By the time Bianca and you finish setting up the equipment to capture images, the penguins have slowly reassembled into a flock and prepared to proceed on their journey.																						
201	900		301									The image and data collection is completed meticulously. As the penguins are about to leave, Bianca and you begin to collect your equipment.																						
202	200		301									However, your gaze is drawn by a lone figure not far away from you.																						
203	201		301									A penguin has left the flock, going the opposite way of their migration route. Slowly and wobbly, it walks toward the icebergs in the distance.																						
204	202		301									And it shows no signs of returning.																						
205	203		302								What's wrong with that penguin?	204																						
206	204		201							1	500533	8																						
207	205		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
208	206		204							1																								
209	207		301								Bianca	The Expedition Team has told me about this. It happens quite often during their migration.	1																					
210	208		301								Bianca	There are always the occasional penguin or two that don't go for the edge of the continental glacier, where the food is, or return to their colony.	1																					
211	209		301								Bianca	Penguins like this one will leave the flock and head inland, taking off for the expanse of Antarctica.	1																					
212	210		301								Bianca	It may travel across ice sheets and climb icebergs...	1																					
213	211		301								Bianca	But all that awaits them after thousands of miles are starvation and death.	1																					
214	212		301								Bianca	People tried to bring them back to their colony, but they would turn around and walk away once the humans were gone.	1																					
215	213		302								...But why?	214																						
216	214		204							1	5																							
217	215		301								Bianca	Well...	1																					
218	216		301									She shakes her head.																						
219	217		204							1																								
220	218		301								Bianca	Environmental degradation, geomagnetic storms, predators, dead nestlings...	1																					
221	219		301								Bianca	Many have made guesses and suggestions.	1																					
222	220		301								Bianca	No one knows the real answer.	1																					
223	221		301									But why would anything head to their deaths so determinedly?																						
224	222		301									There is no friend, no food, no rest.																						
225	223		301									No hesitation, no fear, no going back.																						
226	224		301									No end, no edge, no finish line.																						
227	225		301									Humans cannot fathom this behavior, having believed that survival is the ultimate primal instinct.																						
228	226		301								Bianca	I... don't think they are seeking death.	1																					
229	227		302								Huh?	228																						
230	228		301								Bianca	If they are walking so purposefully, their paths direct and undeterred...	1																					
231	229		301								Bianca	There must be something they are looking for, right?	1																					
232	230		301								Bianca	Except it isn't something they can achieve just by staying with their flock.	1																					
233	231		301								Bianca	Therefore, they have to go on this journey on their own.	1																					
234	232		301									Bianca raises a hand and points toward the snowy hills in the distance.																						
235	233		204							1	1																							
236	234		301								Bianca	Who knows?	1																					
237	235		301								Bianca	Perhaps there is something they want to see beyond this endless whiteness, no matter the cost.	1																					
238	236		301								Bianca	It is their version of "martyrdom."	1																					
239	237		301								Bianca	No one else would understandâ€”but that wouldn't be a problem, would it?	1																					
240	238		302								...	239																						
241	239		204							1	8																							
242	240		301								Bianca	Hmm...	1																					
243	241		204							1																								
244	242		301								Bianca	My apologies. I digress.	1																					
245	243		301								Bianca	Forcing my own imagination onto the behaviors of animals... how stereotypically arrogant for a human.	1
