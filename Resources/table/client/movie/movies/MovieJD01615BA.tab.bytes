9	9		301								Lee	Liv, scan for their locations!	2

14	14		301								Liv	No. Aside from the interfering node, there is a data stream that goes beyond the program module... Can it be...	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	Is the communication between Huaxu and the ground also integrated with this interference module? Such a high degree of aggregation is a reasonable guess considering that the intrusion took place so suddenly.	2																					
16	16		301								Lucia	Which means if we destroy the interfering node, we'll also be able to sever Huaxu's connection with the ground server?	3																					
17	17		301								Lee	Correct, and when that happens, I imagine Huaxu's sub-terminals will be critically hurt.	2
