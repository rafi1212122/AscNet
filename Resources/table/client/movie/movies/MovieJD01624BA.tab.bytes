4	7		301									Everyone wears protective gear and the ship itself has been reinforced, but the highly concentrated Punishing Virus still finds its way in and causes symptoms of infection in everyone.

10	10		301								Lucia	I thought a business area was the same as a business street.	3																					
11	11		301								Liv	They do sound very similar, but they're actually different. I've been here on several rescue missions... a business area has more people and Corrupted than a business street.	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	So it's like a factory, then? I focus so much on fighting that I never paid attention to their difference. I mean, they've both been destroyed beyond recognition, so...	3																					
13	13		301								Lucia	But there is one thing I know about an industrial district.	3																					
14	14		302								The number of Corrupted.	15																						
15	15		301								Lucia	Exactly.	3																					
16	16		301								Lucia	We've reached a fork—the road splits into left and right. Which path are we taking?	3																					
17	17		302								Lee, what's your thought?	18	Lucia, it's up to you!	19	Liv, any thought?	20																		
18	18	21	301								Lee	I don't have enough clues to say much. They look the same.	2																					
19	19	21	301								Lucia	I can't tell you why, but I think we should go right.	3																					
20	20		301								Liv	I think we should go left. It feels more peaceful.	1

23	23		301			DialogEnable					Liv	We now have a rough idea where these paths lead. It's you call, Commandant.	1																					
24	24		301								Liv	It is quite obvious that the road on the left has fewer Corrupted. Most of them are crowding up on the right.	1
