5	5		301			DialogEnable				1		You plan a route from Angel's clues and enter a chemical plant under lockdown.																						
6	6		301								Liv	This chemical plant is huge, but there isn't a path we can go through.	1																					
7	7		302								Should we just climb over, then?	8																						
8	8		301								Lucia	Probably not a good idea to climb over the fence with all the contaminated wastes around.	2																					
9	9		302								Contaminated wastes?	10																						
10	10		301								Liv	(Nods) Rumor has it that somebody tried to resume operations of the plant a few decades ago for power.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	But it ended up causing an accident because they didn't have the technology. These contaminated wastes were left here then and contaminated the land.	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	It's been closed ever since... It's going to be hard for us to travel through this place.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	The contamination is going to have a detrimental effect on Commandant if we keep going.	1																					
14	14		301				DialogDisable				Lucia	There is a security room ahead. Let's go and see what we can find there.	2

17	17		301								Liv	Seems like someone was here not so long ago. Did they leave this key card here?	1																					
18	18		302								Thank you, nice person.	19
