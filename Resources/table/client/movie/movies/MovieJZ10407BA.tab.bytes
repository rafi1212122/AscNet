5	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Snow	God has taught us to be holy, righteous, loving, giving; to love the enemy, fast, pray; to walk in the light, to not be greedy, not to judge; to be sincere and to stay on the path.	1																					
6	5		301								Snow	...To love.	1																					
7	6		301								Snow	But what is love to a... mechanoid? Does love really exist?	1																					
8	7		301								Snow	Even all the sacred texts in the database failed to tell me.	1																					
9	8		301								Snow	...Until I found a baby in the vast snow land, a human baby.	1																					
10	9		301								Snow	She was cowering her fragile body, her skin purple from the cold, yet she quietly looked up at me with her golden eyes.	1																					
11	10		301								Snow	My neural network ran sophisticated calculations and the conclusion I reached was that, even the angel of love was nothing compared to her.	1																					
12	11		301								Snow	I raised her. Mechanoids have no concept of time, but I found that 567648000 seconds passed by in a flash.	1																					
13	12		301								Snow	Bianca, my child, my kind, gentle, strong, and brave child. She loves the world and is full of faith...	1																					
14	13		301								Snow	Even in this time when faith is scarce, when mechanoids teach religion. And I never could tell her the truth.	1																					
15	14		301								Snow	I could explain all religious texts, recite all teachings, yet love was taught to me by my child.	1																					
16	15		301								Snow	If only I were human... If I am qualified as her guardian...	1																					
17	16		301								Snow	If I can see... Bianca, my child... Grow up.	1																					
18	17		301								Snow	...If only.	1																					
19	18		301								Snow	When I saw Miyi, I already understood... I understood that I would never get to see...	1																					
20	19		301								Snow	I separated Bianca from me, had her lead the others away while I locked myself in the basement of the church.	1																					
21	20		301								Snow	I took off the chains on the cross and tightly chained myself up, so tight that the truth of my mechanic presence under the human-like skin was revealed...	1																					
22	21		301								Snow	God loves the world, God blesses the world, yet as a mechanoid, I cannot nor do I need the blessing or protection...	1																					
23	22		301								Snow	But if my constant prayers and pious devotion are worth anything...	1																					
24	23		301								Snow	Please protect my child, Bianca... And all the other human children like Bianca.	1																					
25	24		301								Snow	They are all angels who have fallen into this world...	1																					
26	25		301								Snow	God, if I ever lose myself, I am willing to accept any judgment and punishment...	1																					
27	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Snow	Bianca, my child... Please be safe...	1
