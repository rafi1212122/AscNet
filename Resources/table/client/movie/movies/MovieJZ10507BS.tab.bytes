7	8		301								Robert	Amy taught me the last one.	1																					
8	9		301								Robert	Oh, don't forget to disassemble me before selling my parts. My circulatory energy capsule is a universal one, so it should be able to fetch a high price.	1																					
9	10		301								Robert	Please don't tell Amy for now.	1																					
10	11		301								Robert	As her friend, I don't wish for her to experience the first three things so soon, and never to if possible.	1																					
11	12		301								Robert	As for me... I still don't quite know what it means to be alive. After all, I'm not human.	1																					
12	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Robert	Though from what I can see, surviving is no small feat for humans.	1

18	20		301								Garrison	Robert was not prey. We never saw him as prey.	1																					
19	21		301								Garrison	Do you remember that winter when we almost couldn't make it? Robert... He made a decision back then.	1																					
20	22		301								Garrison	We didn't disassemble him. We couldn't, mentally nor physically.	1																					
21	23		301								Garrison	So he decided to tear off his own energy capsule and created the hunting grounds in the foundation pit.	1																					
22	24		301								Garrison	He used the Corrupted, used the Punishing Virus concentration scale to achieve self-hunting and disassembled himself.	1																					
23	25		301								Garrison	We didn't mean to make the hunting grounds.	1																					
24	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Garrison	But it's also true that we didn't put an end to it.	1
