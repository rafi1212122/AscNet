27	27		301								Meka	You can draw, you can write, and you even sing very well.	2																					
28	28		301								Meka	I hope one day I can see you shine.	2																					
29	29		301								Ayla	Of course! I won't let you down!	1																					
30	30		301								Ayla	I want everybody to see my artwork and listen to my songs! I want everybody to be happy!	1

35	35		301								Meka	Tomorrow I'm taking everyone for an outing as usual. Don't forget to prepare.	2																					
36	36		301								Ayla	Great! I've been waiting for this!	1																					
37	37		301								Ayla	Museum of Human Legacy last year, Construct Research Lab the year before...	1																					
38	38		301								Ayla	Where are we going this year?!	1

44	44		301								Fat Boy	Hehehe... According to my sources, we are definitely going to the garden for a picnic!																						
45	45		301								Lazy Boy	What, not again... I don't want to go for a picnic.																						
46	46		301								Fat Boy	Really?! I can't believe there's someone who doesn't like a picnic! God save him!																						
47	47		301								Lazy Boy	You're just making it up. I'm going backâ€”																						
48	48		301								Fat Boy	Wait! Ahem, I admit that a picnic is my personal preference. But!																						
49	49		301								Fat Boy	This is highly classified information. I'm only telling you because you are my friend! It's the Virtual Convention Center!																						
50	50		301								Lazy Boy	R-really? Are you saying that...																						
51	51		301								Fat Boy	Yeah, that's right! Virtual reality games, baby!																						
52	52		301								Lazy Boy	I won't be able to fall asleep tonight...! Why did you have to tell me...

56	56		301								Fat Boy	Oh, hi, Ayla.																						
57	57		301								Fat Boy	You girls may not know much about games. But if you get to play the game, you'll probably understand how exciting it is!																						
58	58		301								Fat Boy	Imagine you are a powerful Construct, going to an unknown space full of danger.																						
59	59		301								Fat Boy	In your left hand is a sci-fi energy beam weapon, in your right hand is a laser sword.																						
60	60		301								Fat Boy	Three alien monsters suddenly appear in front of youâ€”slash! Pew pew!																						
61	61		301								Fat Boy	One hit, one kill. Then you finish them all with one beam! Bang! How cool is that!

63	63		301							1	Ayla	Hmm... I can imagine that scene. And I should be able to draw it down...?	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301								Lazy Boy	You're a great painter, but you need to actually play it to get the gist.																						
66	66		301								Lazy Boy	Even if you draw it, there's no point... A picture alone can't bring the battlefield to you.																						
67	67		201							1	500120																							
68	68		301							1	Ayla	Huh... Is that so?	1
