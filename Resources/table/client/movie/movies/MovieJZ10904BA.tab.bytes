8	8		301								Meka	Hmm, I just hope you didn't fight. People your age always have different opinions.	1																					
9	9		301								Meka	But they don't know how to take a step back. Because they feel their opinions are the only right option, they try to push each other to believe.	1																					
10	10		301								Meka	Instead of "push," I'd say... It's more like people are trying to change each other with their own understanding.	1																					
11	11		301								Meka	A "victory" may not end well. I have seen many good friends turning against each other—	1																					
12	12		301								Ayla	—Only because of trivial little things.	2																					
13	13		301								Ayla	I know, ma'am. You said it so many times! But Selena and I won't go down that way.	2																					
14	14		301								Meka	That's good. I mean, you don't have a lot of friends, so I'm a bit worried.	1																					
15	15		301								Ayla	Tsk, you just haven't met those I know! Alright, I'm going to start painting. Please see yourself out!	2

23	23		301								Selena's Letter 079	But my position isn't in the frontline. Our squad's mission is to enter the space station and investigate the legacy of humans in the old times.																						
24	24		301								Selena's Letter 079	Archaeology, to put it simply.																						
25	25		301								Selena's Letter 079	This is my first time taking part in such a large-scale operation, not to mention we are going deep into the enemy's base. I'm so nervous.																						
26	26		301								Selena's Letter 079	But I feel quite excited at the same time, looking forward to meeting all the unknowns in the space station.																						
27	27		301								Selena's Letter 079	The veterans said they found many interesting things in the past.																						
28	28		301								Selena's Letter 079	Like an astronaut's personal sketchbook, space photography, etc.																						
29	29		301								Selena's Letter 079	If I can find similar things, I'll make sure I bring them back for you. Oh, I need to watch the Punishing Virus level though...																						
30	30		301								Selena's Letter 079	Speaking of which, have you received the theater software I left you?																						
31	31		301								Selena's Letter 079	Try to experience it like you've never seen it before. You will be surprised.																						
32	32		301								Selena's Letter 079	...I really hope you can tell me your impression in person. Too bad I can't. Just put it in writing if possible.																						
33	33		301								Selena's Letter 079	Well, that's pretty much everything. I'd like to quote the ending of "The Tempest":																						
34	34		301								Selena's Letter 079	Ayla, don't strain your mind with trying to work this strange business out.																						
35	35		301								Selena's Letter 079	At a convenient moment, which will be soon, I'll explain everything and all these strange occurrences will become clear.																						
36	36		301								Selena's Letter 079	Until then, be cheerful, and be assured that all is well.

48	48		301								Ferdinand	I confess for my father's sins! He abandoned the pride of a king and entered the abyss of jealousy.																						
49	49		301								Ferdinand	O wise Duke Prospero, your return truly is my greatest blessing.																						
50	50		301								Ferdinand	Hearing your name, no greater joy would enlighten me more in this world!																						
51	51		301								Duke Prospero	Ferdinand, If I have too austerely punished you, it is but a test for you.																						
52	52		301								Duke Prospero	Your compensation makes amends, for I have given you here a third of mine own life—my daughter, Miranda.																						
53	53		301								Duke Prospero	For which I live till now. Not one moment was I not thinking of her even when your despicable father pushed me off the cliff.																						
54	54		301								Duke Prospero	But you must not take her virginity before the marriage ceremony is performed according to all the sacred traditions.																						
55	55		301								Ferdinand	I look forward to a quiet life, and many years with our love just as it is now. Even the strongest temptations that our lower nature can offer will not ever turn my honor into lust to endanger the joy of our marriage!																						
56	56		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Duke Prospero	Fairly spoken. Behold, Ferdinand, for I must bestow upon the eyes of this young couple some vanity of mine art.
