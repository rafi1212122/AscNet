3	3		301			DialogEnable						Babylonia, Civilian Area.																						
4	4		301									UT. 19:15. The battle between the space station and Babylonia is about to commence.																						
5	5		301								Ayla	Selena mentioned "the real world."																						
6	6		301								Ayla	"Outside the peaceful and harmonious world we lived in, there was another cruel world full of conflict and war."																						
7	7		301								Ayla	What is it like? Will I be able to paint it out?																						
8	8		301								Ayla	You must be fighting there, Selena.																						
9	9		301								Ayla	If your fight is about life and death, I must carry on with mine. We will be fine.																						
10	10		301								Ayla	I will paint your fight so your story can be heard!																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Will I be able to understand you then...?																						
12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Ayla	...Must set the tone first... The colors of the universe... And stars...																						
13	13		301								Ayla	...Hmm... Something like this?																						
14	14		301								Ayla	...Now... Selena's fighting stance...																						
15	15		301								Ayla	...Oh, those boys probably know better...																						
16	16		301								Ayla	... (Busy drawing)																						
17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	...Flames, explosions, laser beam... How about that?																						
18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Ayla	Done!																						
19	19		301								Ayla	...No. Something's not right. I have seen many artworks depicting war. It's not like this.																						
20	20		301								Ayla	Is this too naive...?																						
21	21		301								Ayla	More like a landscape painting. I can only feel the beauty of the starry sky and Selena's grace... Too bright? Too light-hearted? Hmm, the vibe is just too far off!																						
22	22		301								Ayla	If I take this to someone, the only answers I'll get will be "this is a child's imagination," or "this doesn't resemble war at all."																						
23	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	...Have I hit a bottleneck? Is there something that cannot be represented by painting...?

25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—!																						
26	26		301									A swarm of aircraft leave the space station, charging toward Babylonia in the orbit.																						
27	27		301									Cannons start firing. Cruise missiles are launched. Just like that, the war begins.																						
28	28		301									Meanwhile, Babylonia's plan is being executed.																						
29	29		301									As more fighter aircrafts leave the port, the special task force also departs.																						
30	30		301									According to the plan, they will be escorted near the space station before landing, and investigate the internal facilities.																						
31	31		301									Apart from military and research-related intelligence, they also want to retrieve the relics left by humans in the old times.																						
32	32		301									Even normal objects for daily use could turn into antiques with incredible value.																						
33	33		301									Step by step, humans evolved over time. As a whole, and as individuals.																						
34	34		301								Ayla	I heard sounds...! The battle has started!																						
35	35		301								Ayla	Selena... I hope she will be fine.																						
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Oh, what's that...!

39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Ayla witnesses the battle through Babylonia's barrier.																						
40	40		301									Flames, explosions, aircraft debris.																						
41	41		301									The cruel scene shocks her as if time had stopped.																						
42	42		301								Ayla	Is this... war?																						
43	43		301								Ayla	This is nothing like I imagined... Red lights, yellow dust, cold and dark space...																						
44	44		301								Ayla	The starry sky used to be beautiful. Why does it suddenly look so harsh...																						
45	45		301								Ayla	Those debris must have come from aircraft. Maybe even Constructs.																						
46	46		301								Ayla	If a person is hit in this battle... There won't be any remains left at all.																						
47	47		301								Ayla	...I understand now. Compared to this, my own interpretation of war is so naive and simple.																						
48	48		301								Ayla	People can die any time. War could break out at any time. This is the reality we live in.																						
49	49		301								Ayla	Unlike the peaceful cities. Unlike games, where I can restart after death...																						
50	50		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	If one can't appreicate the cruelty of the world, then I supposed they never be able to capture the reality of war with their paint brush...
