5	5		301								Andre	Her name is... I'll just let her introduce herself because I don't know her name.	1

11	11		201							2	500132		400																					
12	12		301							1	Andre	No one would call a girl "Hyena", unless you can prove yourself.	1																					
13	13		301								"Hyena"	...	2																					
14	14		202							1	2				1																			
15	15		301								???	Boss, our standards are getting lower and lower! You bring back kid this time, are you gonna bring back a cripple next time?

18	18		202							1					1																			
19	19		301									As if sensing "Hyena" is about to explode in anger, Andre puts a hand on her shoulder to hold her back.																						
20	20		201							1	500139																							
21	21		301							1	Andre	He means no ill.	1

25	25		301									Feeling "Hyena" relaxing under his hand, he lets go of his hand.																						
26	26		201							1	500139																							
27	27		301							1	Andre	What, Clegg? Do you have opinions on how I pick people?	1																					
28	28		301								Andre	Did I make the wrong choice when picking you or the others here?	1																					
29	29		202							1					1																			
30	30		301								Clegg	O-of course not!																						
31	31		201							1	500139																							
32	32		301							1	Andre	Then that's that. You're thinking you can finally get rid of your last place title now that a kid's here, aren't you?	1																					
33	33		202							1					1																			
34	34		301								Clegg	Well, she's a kid. How can I be worse than a kid...																						
35	35		201							1	500139																							
36	36		301							1	Andre	Heh, we'll see.	1																					
37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		301									Andre smirks before pushing "Hyena" into the crowd of workers.																						
39	39		201							1	500139																							
40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Andre	From today on, she'll be a part of the investigation team. Clegg, you're in charge of her!	1																					
41	41		202							1					1																			
42	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Clegg	Aww, come on... Why'd it have to be me...																						
43	43		301								Clegg	Hey! You! Listen up. I may have the worse scores during training, but the investigation team is always the busiest!																						
44	44		301								Clegg	Alright, there's a pipeline failure in section B of the exhaust gas recovery system. Go have a look.																						
45	45		201							1	500132																							
46	46		301							1	"Hyena"	...Good.	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301								Clegg	If you can fix it, then fix it. If you can't, come back and tell me.																						
49	49		201							1	500132																							
50	50		301							1	"Hyena"	...Where are the maintenance tools?	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301								Clegg	Looks like you know the basics. You've seen us working before? It's on the shelf over there next to the mop bucket.																						
53	53		201							1	500132																							
54	54		301							1	"Hyena"	...	1																					
55	55		202							1					1																			
56	56		301									"Hyena" quietly takes the tool kit off the shelf and straps it to her back. She then pushes open the door and leaves.																						
57	57		301								Inspection Team Member	Aren't you being a little too harsh, Clegg?																						
58	58		301								Inspection Team Member	According to the rules, members have to undergo three months of training before they can attend to exhaust gas maintenance...																						
59	59		301								Clegg	That's a rule for newbies who know nothing.																						
60	60		301								Clegg	I don't know why the boss decided to recruit a kid, but I hope he has his reasons.																						
61	61		301								Clegg	If she's just a normal kid then I don't mind being the villain here.																						
62	62		301								Clegg	Of course, I hope she'd just be a normal kid, scurrying home crying. That tool kit can be sold in exchange for food for a few days. It's not a bad deal for her.																						
63	63		301								Inspection Team Member	But what if the boss asks?																						
64	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Clegg	Whatever. I doubt he'd want to see a newbie gone after a few jobs again.																						
65	65		201							1	500132

68	68		301									When Clegg wakes up from his nap and sees a "Hyena" covered in dirt and oil before him, an hour has already passed.																						
69	69		301								Clegg	What the...?! You almost gave me a heart attack there! How's the exhaust gas recovery system?																						
70	70		201							1	500132																							
71	71		301							1	"Hyena"	...I found this stuck in the pipe.	1																					
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		301									"Hyena" tosses an oily balled-up cloth onto the ground in front of Clegg. The logo of the inspection team could still be seen vaguely.																						
74	74		301								Clegg	I thought I'd stuck it in deep enough... Never thought you'd find it.																						
75	75		201							1	500132																							
76	76		301							1	"Hyena"	Why did you do it?	1																					
77	77		301								"Hyena"	...Do you hate me?	1																					
78	78		202							1					1																			
79	79		301								Clegg	Not really, but if the boss tossed me someone with no credentials, then I'd have to find the evidence myself to prove she's reliable.																						
80	80		301								Clegg	I was wrong. If you wanna tell the boss, you're free to do so.																						
81	81		201							1	500132																							
82	82		301							1	"Hyena"	...	1																					
83	83		202							1					1																			
84	84		301									Clegg and "Hyena" stare at each other, hoping to find the answer in the other's eyes. They were suddenly interrupted by Andre pushing open the door.

86	86		201							2	500132		400																					
87	87		301							1	Andre	Clegg! You little s**t, I heard you ordered the new girl to repair the exhaust gas recovery system!	1																					
88	88		301								Clegg & "Hyena"	...!	2																					
89	89		301								Andre	I'm only going to ask you this, what's your conclusion? You only keep those who are useful, which is why I entrusted her to you.	1																					
90	90		202							1	2				1																			
91	91		301									Clegg raises his hands and diverts his gaze away from "Hyena".																						
92	92		301								Clegg	She passed. Looks like I get to keep the honor of being in last place.																						
93	93		201							1	500139																							
94	94		301							1	Andre	Good. I was most worried about your attitude when I took her in.	1																					
95	95		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Andre	That's settled then! Kid, here's your uniform! Look at how dirty you are, go take shower! We left the shower empty just for you!	1

98	98		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It has been 197 days since "Hyena" joined the inspection team. She never cared to keep count of the days, but now, every day is precious to her.																						
99	99		301									It was everything she had ever dreamt ofâ€”bed fluffier than steel slabs and asbestos, two whole meals a day, at least 6 hours of sleep every night, a hot shower every two days...																						
100	100		301									Chief Andre may look like a tough guy, but deep down he was very thoughtful and considerate, he knew how to make tasty scrambled eggs and resizing uniforms for small girls.																						
101	101		301									As long as people do not make fun of his treasured badgeâ€”which he claims to be an authentic royal tokenâ€”he does not mind most of the time.																						
102	102		301									Leader Clegg, always ranking last, but he can remember where every wrench and every screw is; stubborn and stingy, and also short-sighted.																						
103	103		301									Leader Katyusha, the leader of the structure team. One of the only three females in the whole inspection team. She can run faster than anyone in a 10km run with weights. She is also one of the few that were present on "that day."																						
104	104		301									As for "Hyena"... Well, she's no longer "Hyena" now. Lena from the structure team gave her a new nameâ€”"Sophia".																						
105	105		301									From what she's heard, this is the name of Chief Andre's homeland. And in the language of the Golden Age, it meant "gift from God".																						
106	106		301									Recently, someone found a movie from the Golden Age.																						
107	107		301									And after that, Chief Andre insists on others calling him "Boss" like Clegg does.																						
108	108		301									It has been 197 days since Sophia joined the inspection team.

113	113		301								Sophia	It's... Sophia's, first time... bring tiim to work outside.	1																					
114	114		301								Andre	Sophia! It's time!																						
115	115		301								Sophia	(...I'll get back to this later.)	1
