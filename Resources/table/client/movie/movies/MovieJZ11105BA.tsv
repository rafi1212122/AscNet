13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Deep Voice	What's the situation?																						
14	14		301								Sharp Voice	We've finished cleaning up. It's a miracle no one from the inspection team lived, but it has caused too much of a commotion to stay under wraps.																						
15	15		301								Sharp Voice	If "she" finds out...																						
16	16		301								Deep Voice	Tsk... There's nothing she can do about it even if she does find out.																						
17	17		301								Sharp Voice	Well... You were the one who ordered us to disobey "her"...																						
18	18		301								Sharp Voice	Although you'll most likely keep your head, it's true that you disobeyed the leader. There'll be punishments.																						
19	19		301								Deep Voice	That doesn't concern you. I've served under ol' Amir. His daughter can't even hold a gun properly, let alone going against me.																						
20	20		301								Deep Voice	Although...																						
21	21		301								Sharp Voice	My lord...?																						
22	22		301								Deep Voice	That little brat who crashed my birthday party the other day... What happened to her?																						
23	23		301								Sharp Voice	There were too many witnesses so we had to get her to a doctor.																						
24	24		301								Sharp Voice	The doctor told me that there's no hope saving the lower half of her body and that she only has less than 36 hours left.																						
25	25		301								Sharp Voice	If you were planning to silence her, my lord, then we do not need to do anything at all.																						
26	26		301								Deep Voice	That's not what I'm thinking.																						
27	27		301								Deep Voice	We need to do something. We need her to live.																						
28	28		301								Sharp Voice	My lord?																						
29	29		301								Deep Voice	This is a chance to plant the seeds of "hate", we can't let it go to waste.																						
30	30		301								Sharp Voice	My lord, you're not...																						
31	31		301								Deep Voice	Go make the arrangements. Now. Time's a-ticking.																						
32	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Deep Voice	It's time for us to teach that so-called "leader" a lesson.

35	35		301								Sharp Voice	It's not easy to find all the equipment and components on a train, let alone to do it in less than 4 hours.																						
36	36		301								Sharp Voice	If anything goes wrong...																						
37	37		301								Technician	W-we understand the orders.																						
38	38		301								Technician	My family... Please don't hurt them.																						
39	39		301								Sharp Voice	Hmph, that depends on the outcome of your work.																						
40	40		301								Sharp Voice	Lord "Ashlar" is a man of his word!

47	47		301								Technician	Give her a standard dose of adrenaline and then prepare to commence organ replacement.																						
48	48		301								Sharp Voice	I see, so this is the technology retrieved from City 173.																						
49	49		301								Technician	N-not only that, we also learned from "that experiment", to use the technology from Babylonia Construct parts to strengthen the system.																						
50	50		301								Technician	Hey, it's time to replace the skeleton, quit dilly-dallying! I can't do it alone!																						
51	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Technician	C-coming!																						
52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Technician	...All vitals are normal, the secondary "heart" and tantalum "cerebellum" are fully functional.

58	58		301								Sharp Voice	I hope you'll be able to demonstrate as much hate as the love they've shown you... Hehehe.																						
59	59		301								Technician	Uhm, does this mean we can...																						
60	60		301								Sharp Voice	Scram. Your work here is done.																						
61	61		301								Technician	Th-thank you!

104	104		301								Letter	Akdilek Jamilah Amir is no longer fit to rule Akdilek. She became the enemy of Akdilek the moment she forced us to carry out her absurd orders.
