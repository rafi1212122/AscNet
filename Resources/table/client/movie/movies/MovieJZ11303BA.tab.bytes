5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Squadron Leader	So you're one of the newbies?	1																					
6	6		301								Vera	Yes. Nice to meet you.	2																					
7	7		301									After receiving permission, Vera is now officially qualified to join missions as a soldier.																						
8	8		201							1	500019		400																					
9	9		301							1	Construct Member	A Military Academy student? Tch, they didn't even send us a graduate?	1																					
10	10		301									Besides the Squadron Leader, who is studying the files in front of Vera, there are a few other Construct members on the teams, though not all of them are professional soldiers.																						
11	11		301									Still, in missions such as this one, professional soldiers are always way more valuable than civilian Constructs. To veterans like these, Vera, who has not even graduated, is practically a civilian as well.																						
12	12		301								Vera	...I'll do my best not to drag everyone down.	2																					
13	13		301									Vera knows the unspoken rules. She ignores the gazes of the others and chooses to keep a low profile.																						
14	14		201							1	500028		400																					
15	15		301								Squadron Leader	Good. Everyone else get over here for the briefing.	1																					
16	16		301									The Squadron Leader turns on the portable holo-projector and marks out several areas on the battlefield.																						
17	1000		301								Squadron Leader	We've got a S&D mission this time, with a medium level of Punishing Virus detected. For Constructs like us, we should be able to survive a few hours in the area without problem.	1																					
18	18		301								Vera	So should we be prepared for a long-term operation?	2																					
19	19		301								Squadron Leader	No. We'll just remain in the safe sections and take out the targets the others missed.	1																					
20	20		301								Vera	Huh?	2																					
21	21		301									Vera is shocked at the answer she received. Apparently the Squadron Leader is not at all dedicated to completing the mission and instead just wants to take out stragglers.																						
22	22		301								Vera	Wait... Wouldn't this make things harder for the other squads out there, or even make the mission impossible to complete?	2																					
23	23		301								Squadron Leader	Who cares as long as things aren't harder for us? Fight safe and steady, survive, earn merit... that's what our objective should be.	1																					
24	24		301								Vera	But that doesn't make sense. What's the use of merit in times like these? We're Constructs now. That's how serious the virus has gotten.	2																					
25	25		301								Vera	If we don't defeat the Corrupted when we can, we'll be destroyed regardless of merit!	2

28	28		301							1	Construct Member	Just follow the leader's orders, newb. He's doing this for our own good.	1																					
29	29		301									A squad member interrupts Vera's protests and explains to her the reasoning behind the leader's decision.																						
30	30		301								Construct Member	You're lucky to have been appointed to our squad. Boss, it shouldn't make any difference if we tell her about you-know-what, right?	1																					
31	31		201							1	500028																							
32	32		301							1	Squadron Leader	Yeah, fill her in. That should save us lots of pointless arguments in the long run.	1

36	36		301							1	Vera	You-know-what?	2																					
37	37		301								Construct Member	While we're not sure when it's going to happen, the combat headquarters are preparing to evacuate.	1																					
38	38		301								Vera	Evacuate... You mean abandon the current outer-rim cities?	2																					
39	39		301								Construct Member	It's on a larger scale than that. We're moving base to outer space.	1																					
40	40		301								Vera	Outer space... But do we have enough space stations to hold all the people?	2																					
41	41		202							1	2																							
42	42		201							1	500028																							
43	43		301							1	Squadron Leader	The space station isn't the point. They've got this massive spaceship. Though it's not up to par to the initial design standards, it's capable of following a certain orbit.	1																					
44	44		202							1																								
45	45		201							1	500019		400																					
46	46		201							2	500182	14	-400																					
47	47		301							1	Construct Member	Of course, there's a limited number of slots.	1																					
48	48		301									The limited number of slotsâ€”that must be the reason for their strategy. They fight to survive and gain merit, so that the people up there will take their contributions into consideration.																						
49	49		301									So that eventually, they will get to be the privileged few to "evacuate."																						
50	50		301									Vera shuts up. These people in front of her are certainly not going to change their minds just because of her, so she clenches her fist and turns up the pain receptor thresholds in order to keep her anger under control.																						
51	51		201							1	500028		400																					
52	52		301							1	Squadron Leader	Anyway, Vera, since you're a newbie, you can just stay in the back and watch.	1																					
53	53		301								Vera	You don't need me on the front lines?	2																					
54	54		301								Squadron Leader	You'd only slow us down from there. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.	1																					
55	55		301								Vera	...Got it.	2																					
56	56		202							1	2																							
57	57		401							2	1502																							
58	58		301									The time for the operation to begin rolls around, and the squad marches off with their gear.																						
59	59		301									Vera is the only one who remains, watching over the terminal the Squadron Leader left behind.																						
60	60		301									There is no point sending an excessive number of units just for a S&D operation, which must be why the Squadron Leader chose this passive approach.																						
61	61		301									Even if they survive with the contributions to show, those in charge still would not hold them to high esteem if the operation itself failed.																						
62	62		301									Then the answer is simple. They need to reap the benefits as much as they can while ensuring the success of the mission. Short-sighted, but down-to-earth, these squad members are a war-savvy few.																						
63	63		201							1	500182	4																						
64	64		301							1	Vera	But... there are two combat zones within this area. And the outer-rim section the squad's heading to should be this one...	1																					
65	65		301									Vera zooms in on the area map, pans through it and starts outlining various itineraries.																						
66	66		301									To Vera, whose interests lie in tactical prediction, this process is a effortless one. She marks down the travel route of the Corrupted, including those from the other battle sites.																						
67	67		301									And that is how she discovers the converging spot of the two battle sites.																						
68	68		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Oh no...	1
