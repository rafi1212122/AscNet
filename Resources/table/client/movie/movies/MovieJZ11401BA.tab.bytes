4	4		301			RImgBg1Shake						A fawnling comes tumbling out of the forest and falls beside a tree.																						
5	5		301									Impacting the tree, the sheets of snow on top fall like an avalanche. The calf's bleeding wound is like a scar on the powdery white snow.

9	9		301							1		An old man with a shotgun on his back walks out of the bushes. Patting the snow off his clothes, he kneels to observe the fallen reindeer.

14	14		301							1		The bushes rustle, and a little girl hobbles out. She must be the Rosetta that the old man is calling.	2																					
15	15		301								Rosetta	Grandpa Pfaff?	2																					
16	16		301								Pfaff	I'll leave this fella to you. You need to learn to survive in the forest.	1

19	19		301							1		The reindeer is still struggling on the verge of death. Blood gushes from its shotgun wound as it breathes rapidly.	1

21	21		301							1		Rosetta wields her knife and approaches the reindeer. The teary and hopeless look in its eyes causes her to wince.	1																					
22	22		301									But she knows that her grandfather would never allow her to show any sign of weakness. She tries to restrain the trembling tip of her knife, and aims it at the reindeer's throat.	1																					
23	23		301									Right before Rosetta finally makes up her mind to stab the deer, Pfaff lets out a quiet sigh.	1

26	26		301							1	Pfaff	Rosetta... What about the prayer?	1																					
27	27		301								Rosetta	Sorry, Grandpa. I forgot...	2																					
28	28		301									Rosetta hurriedly rests her knife on the floor and closes her eyes to pray.	1	2																				
29	29		301								Pfaff	Remember, Rosetta... You must always remember to pay respects to nature and life.	1																					
30	30		301								Pfaff	The greatest calamities come from humanity's arrogance. Do you get it?	1																					
31	31		301									When Rosetta opened her eyes, the calf has already gone still. The fearful eyes are also closed.	1	2																				
32	32		301									She breathes a sigh of relief, and begins to skillfully skin the reindeer of its still steaming flesh and bones.	1	2																				
33	33		301								Rosetta	Oh yeah, Grandpa. The Fishing Guild was looking for you. I think they're...	2																					
34	34		301								Pfaff	I told you a thousand times! Don't speak to outsiders! Don't even go near them! You know that they...	1																					
35	35		301									Pfaff's sudden outburst causes Rosetta to recoil.	1	2																				
36	36		301								Rosetta	He didn't see me... I just... saw him looking around in front of the house. I thought he was a thief at first...	2																					
37	37		301									Pfaff takes in a deep breath to cool down.	1																					
38	38		301								Pfaff	Even if he's a thief, they aren't someone a kid like you should be messing around with. You got it?	1																					
39	39		301									Rosetta quietly nods, afraid to say anything else.		2																				
40	40		301								Pfaff	The guild members must be here on an investigation... I'll go to the port tomorrow. Just stay at home and don't go out.	1																					
41	41		301								Rosetta	Alright... Got it, Grandpa.	2																					
42	42		301								Pfaff	I'll stop by the market on the way back...	1																					
43	43		301									Seeing Rosetta's puzzled look, Pfaff's expression softens.	1	2																				
44	44		301								Pfaff	I'll bring you a carving knife. I know you've always wanted one.	1																					
45	45		204							2	6																							
46	46		301								Rosetta	R-really?	2																					
47	47		202							1	2																							
48	48		301									When Rosetta was a child, Pfaff would make wood carvings to either sell them at the market or for Rosetta to play with as toys.	1																					
49	49		301									The little girl gradually took an interest to wood carving. Pfaff had known for some time; he just kept silent.	1	2																				
50	50		201							1	500200																							
51	51		301							1	Pfaff	It's almost nighttime. Let's pack up and hurry on back. Winter will come early this yearâ€”and so will the tide.	1																					
52	52		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1		Pfaff squints. In the far distance, he could make out the raucous noises of the bionics.	1
