26	2301		204							3	6																							
27	24		301								Rosetta	Grandpa said the Narwhal's the Guardian Spirit of humanity. It wouldn't just destroy the port for nothing. There must be a reason...	3

29	26		301									To Rosetta's surprise, the fishermen around her bursts out laughing.

41	38		301									The fisherman could no longer control his temper and rushes over to grab Rosetta. However, Rosetta quickly catches his wrist and twists it behind his back.																						
42	39		301								Fisher	Ow! You lil' sardine! Damn it! Let go!	2																					
43	40		301								Rosetta	I won't let you go unless you apologize to the Guardian Spirit and to us!	1

46	42		301							1	Port Manager	Damn it!	1																					
47	43		301									The port manager could no longer take it. He clenches his fist to swing at Rosetta.																						
48	44		301									However, his punch is stopped mid-swing by the steel grip of an old but firm hand.																						
49	45		201							1	500200																							
50	46		301							1	Pfaff	She's my granddaughter. Just a child. Don't be so hard on her, big guy.	1

52	48		301							1	Rosetta	Grandpa!	1																					
53	49		301									The port manager shakes off Pfaff. At the sight of Pfaff, Rosetta lets go of the fisherman.

60	56		301							1		Pfaff shields Rosetta behind the rowdy crowd. He slams the butt of his shotgun on the ground, letting off a loud thud.	1																					
61	57		301								Pfaff	Listen up!	1																					
62	58		301									The presence of the shotgun, coupled with Pfaff's fierce glare instantly silences the commotion.																						
63	59		301								Pfaff	I will hunt the narwhal alone tomorrow, but at one request.	1																					
64	60		201							1	500086

67	63		301									The mocking laughter of the crowd resumes, but Pfaff seems to pay no mind. He pushes his way through the crowd, coming before the port manager.

70	66		301							1	Port Manager	What makes you think you can kill the narwhal?	1																					
71	67		301									Pfaff lowers his voice so that only the port manager could hear. At his words, the manager stiffens and takes on a solemn expression.																						
72	68		301								Port Manager	Are you serious...? This is too much for a joke.	1																					
73	69		301								Pfaff	I stake my life on it.	2																					
74	70		301								Port Manager	Hmph, your life means little to me. But...	1																					
75	71		202							1	2																							
76	72		301									The manager shifts his gaze at the Rosetta behind Pfaff. For this little girl, the old man would never lie.																						
77	73		201							1	500093																							
78	74		301							1	Port Manager	Alright, fine. I will inform the captain.	1																					
79	75		301								Port Manager	But remember... If you fail, you will bear all the consequences. I'm sure you know what that means for you and your granddaughter.	1																					
80	76		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Pfaff glances at the port manager. He grabs Rosetta's hand and leaves the port under the gazes of the crowd.

86	82		301								Rosetta	Grandpa, didn't you say that the narwhal was the Guardian Spirit of humanity?! Why are you killing it? I don't get it!	2																					
87	83		301									Pfaff sighs. The steam from his breath escapes into the snowy forest.																						
88	84		301								Pfaff	It's okay. You don't need to understand. Just know that this is my decision. That's all.	1																					
89	8401		204							2	5																							
90	85		301								Rosetta	The thing about the Guardian Spirit protecting usâ€”protecting humanity... Was it all a lie?	2																					
91	86		301								Pfaff	Rosetta, it's just a mechanical narwhal. You are a human; you need human friends.	1																					
92	87		301									Rosetta is about to retort, but Pfaff quickly interrupts her.																						
93	88		301								Pfaff	I'll set out tomorrow morning. If I don't return in a month, run. Go as far as you can into the forest.	1

107	101		301								Rosetta	If you're gonna kill the Guardian Spirit, I wanna be a witness to it!	1

109	103		301									Pfaff stares at Rosetta bitterly. This girl grew up to be just as stubborn as he is.																						
110	104		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Without a word, he untethers the small fishing boat. Starting the engine, the two gradually leave shore.
