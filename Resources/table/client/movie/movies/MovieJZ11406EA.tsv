27	26		301									The unrelenting nightmare of the past eats away at the Arctic. It binds itself around not only Rosetta and Pfaff, but also the Forest Guards... and everyone here.

45	44		301									"...Dead." The words remain unsaid.																						
46	45		301									But Rosetta refuses to let go of Pfaff's body. As long as she held on to Pfaff, he would never truly leave her...																						
47	46		201							1	500213	14																						
48	47		301								Rosetta	No, that can't be... Grandpa, he... Not even bionics the size of a bear could stop him. How could he...	1

51	50		301							1	Port Manager	Rosetta! You're back?	1																					
52	51		301									The port manager pushes aside the crowd as he rushes to Rosetta. He signals Lisa to step aside and whispers to Rosetta.																						
53	52		301								Port Manager	What about the narwhal? Where's the thing that Pfaff promised?	1																					
54	53		201							1	500213	14																						
55	54		301							1		Rosetta shakes her head and slowly lays down Pfaff's body. With tears streaming down her cheeks, she wipes his face covered in blood and vital fluid from the bionics.	1

57	56		301							1	Port Manager	Pfaff kicked it, huh... But no matter, I never had any faith in him to begin with.	1

73	72		301									The port manager waves, signaling several technicians to come over. The technicians step forward, beginning to prepare to dismantle the narwhal.																						
74	73		301								Port Manager	He gave his life for the Arctic Route Union. I will honor my promise to him and allow you to join us.	1

83	81		301								Port Manager	Guardian Spirit? You still on about this...?																						
84	82		301									The port manager and all of the other people in the port begin to uproar in protest, but no one dares to cross Rosetta's spear.																						
85	83		301								Port Citizen	You're calling this plague that destroyed the port a guardian spirit? No way you'll fit in in the union!																						
86	84		301									Rosetta remains indifferent to the lambasting port citizens, for she has long since known that they are cowardly and timid.																						
87	85		301								Rosetta	These people... are the ones that Grandpa, Derek, and the Forest Guards are trying to protect...																						
88	86		301								Rosetta	Derek! Do you hear me?!
