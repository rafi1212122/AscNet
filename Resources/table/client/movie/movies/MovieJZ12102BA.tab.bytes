4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Kurono Researcher	Yarha, the leader is looking for you...	1																					
5	5		301								Kurono Researcher	How can you still be working at a time like this? Pulling another all-nighter?	1																					
6	6		301									The man sitting at his desk waves his left hand in dismissal, not even bothering to lift his head up from the screen.

9	9		301							1	Yarha	Incredible, absolutely incredible. Only a genius like me would come up with something like this...	2																					
10	10		301									The researcher who entered the laboratory looks around at the research books scattered all over the room and sighs.																						
11	11		301								Kurono Researcher	...You mean that half-finished mechanoid prototype from the Daedalus' research division?	1																					
12	12		301								Yarha	No, no... It's far more than just a prototype now.	2																					
13	13		301									The man named Yarha steps aside, revealing the fruits of his labor.																						
14	14		301									The hologram of a Construct is floating above the large desk.																						
15	15		301								Yarha	Because of her physique, I installed a M.I.N.D. interface onto a weapon link and weaponized the Medic Bot into a brand new external mobile device for her to use in combat.	2																					
16	16		301								Yarha	I call it a "Co-Bot".	2																					
17	17		301								Yarha	This modification helps stabilize her M.I.N.D. while also functioning as an unprecedented combat system.	2																					
18	18		301								Yarha	However, this combat system is only suitable for her at this point. After all, we'd be hard-pressed to find someone with a similar framework.	2																					
19	19		301								Yarha	Take a look at this.	2																					
20	22		301									Yarha taps the battle simulation interface and plays a recording of No. 21 fighting Corrupted. On the screen, No. 21 and the "Co-Bot" can be seen fighting hand in glove as a highly synergized team.																						
21	23		301								Yarha	Unimaginable burst damage. Environmental adaptability. This is my magnum opus...																						
22	27		301								Kurono Researcher	No wonder I haven't seen you around recently. You've already made this much progress?	1																					
23	28		301								Yarha	It's not complete yet. I still haven't thought of a way to reduce the severity of her M.I.N.D. fluctuations. She's going to need a lot of recalibrating before she's combat-ready.	2																					
24	29		301								Kurono Researcher	In that case, I'll leave you to your work then. Don't forget to go to the training ground. The leader is looking for you.	1																					
25	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Yarha	Alright. I'll go after I wash up and eat some breakfast.	2

31	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Yarha	You're deploying her into battle?!	1																					
32	37		301								Kurono Leader	Correct. You've already spent enough time on development. We need to see results.	2																					
33	38		301									In the office next to the training ground, a Kurono official dressed in all black sits behind the desk. As he speaks, he taps his index finger on the desk for emphasis.																						
34	39		301								Yarha	And for good reason! She'll be one-of-a-kind!	1																					
35	40		301								Kurono Leader	Kurono isn't a place for you to live out your wildest research fantasies. You haven't forgotten why you chose to stay here. Have you, Yarha?	2																					
36	41		301								Yarha	...	1																					
37	42		301								Kurono Leader	You are an important member of Kurono. You wasted your time on your latest creation when you could have been helping Kurono ascend to greater heights in other aspects.	2																					
38	43		301								Kurono Leader	You know this. We know this. Yet I humored you because I believe this "small sacrifice" was worth it to Kurono.	2																					
39	44		301								Kurono Leader	Now tell me, will you betray Kurono's trust in you?	2																					
40	45		301								Yarha	...Understood. But the field test must be conducted under my supervision.	1																					
41	46		301								Kurono Leader	Of course. No. 21's frame has already been brought here. Let's begin.	2																					
42	47		301								Yarha	When did you bring... Forget it. Very well, as you wish.	1																					
43	48		202							1	2				1																			
44	49		301									Yarha walks to the console stationed behind ballistic glass facing the training ground. From here, the entire field can be seen at a glance like the best seat in a theater.																						
45	50		301								Kurono Leader	Good, Yarha. Let the show begin.																						
46	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Kurono Leader	Show us that "one-of-a-kind frame" you're so proud of.

49	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Following a loud rumbling sound, a transparent cylindrical container slowly descends from the ceiling of the training center.																						
50	55		301									A pure white Construct is submerged within the liquid-filled container, her long hair floating and swaying. A spherical machine can be seen next to her.																						
51	56		301									When the container arrives at the center of the training ground, the liquid is pumped out and the Construct's feet land on solid ground. A gust of air fills the container, causing her hair to float up and obscure her pale face.																						
52	57		401							2	1515																							
53	58		301								System	Activating frame... 20%... 50%...

55	60		301								System	Initiating cognition—																						
56	61		301								System	Initiating combat system—																						
57	62		301									Yarha wipes the sweat off his forehead. His breathing stabilizes as the frame begins to activate. Behind him, he feels an intense glare giving him no choice but to continue with the procedure.																						
58	63		201							1	500344					1																		
59	64		301							1		The strong gust of air in the container gradually subsides now that the Construct is completely dry. The girl standing in the container remains calm as if she has just woken up.																						
60	65		301								System	Activation complete.																						
61	66		301									But Yarha knows that this is only the calm before the storm.																						
62	67		301									The glass walls of the container begin to lower. The Construct slowly opens her eyes. A red light flashes by.																						
63	68		202							1					1																			
64	69		301								Yarha	...Let the Construct field test begin. Level One...																						
65	70		301								Kurono Leader	Level one? Lacking confidence in your work?																						
66	71		301								Yarha	But...																						
67	72		301									Yarha closes his eyes, then opens his eyes with a resolute expression.																						
68	73		301								Yarha	...Initiate level three.																						
69	74		301								System	Understood.																						
70	75		401							2	1515

74	79		401							2	1509																							
75	80		301									Following the notification, the area surrounding the training ground begins to shake. The rumbles draw closer, and the floor opens as countless Corrupted swarm out from within. The silent training ground is instantly filled with the mechanoids' hissing.																						
76	81		301								Yarha	...Good luck.																						
77	82		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Yarha's whisper is obscured by the hissing, making it inaudible.

81	86		301									Who... am I?																						
82	87		301									She is bewildered for a moment over these existential questions.

86	91		301									A moment later, a gust of wind brings her back to reality.																						
87	92		301									Danger. Unknown. Darkness. Death. Battle.																						
88	93		301									That is all she sees, hears, and smells. Faced with all of this, "confusion" falls by the wayside.																						
89	94		301									Countless mechanoids with menacing red eyes charge her like a flood, about to engulf and scatter her existence.																						
90	95		301								No. 21	Danger... Kill...																						
91	96		301									She clenches her fists. The desire to attack surges up from the depths of her frame, overwhelming her. She retreats a step, arches her back, and growls like a wild animal, exposing her fangs in preparation to fight this "unknown danger."																						
92	97		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	Eliminate... danger.
