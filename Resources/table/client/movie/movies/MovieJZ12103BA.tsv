8	8		201							1	500328																							
9	9		301							1		At 7 o'clock, she no longer needs to wash up now that she is a Construct. She stands in front of the mirror, looking at her strange new frame.	1																					
10	10		301									She no longer needs the Medic Bot, even though it is still by her side. Looking at "him" quietly, she sees "him" waving a slender mechanoid arm at her in response. That is new.	1																					
11	11		301									At 8 o'clock, Kurono personnel begin work. No. 21's room is no longer at the end of the corridor. Sitting in front of the window, she sees humans wearing all sorts of different colors... She even sees Constructs walking around.																						
12	12		301									Most people wear black, while other people wear colorful clothes. The colors combine in a variety of interesting patterns. No. 21 watches them intently.

16	16		301									No. 21 stands up and walks to the door. She stands there, confused at the noise. The knocking becomes louder and more hurried.

104	104		301								No. 21	Why?	1																					
105	105		301								Vera	Because I saved you. If it wasn't for me, you'd be a pile of scrap by now. If you don't, you'll be discarded. Is that what you want?	2

126	126		301									Vera casts a sideways glare and warns them coldly.																						
127	127		301									Vera has always been a lone wolf, and her arrogance always caused friction among her and the other Kurono Constructs. She's often ridiculed for her past experience and the fact that she has never been a member of a team.																						
128	128		301								???	Laugh it up all you want. Not like we'll be the one with a dead team member on our hands.	1																					
129	129		301								Vera	I can offer you a dead member right now if you like. What do you say?	2

134	134		301								???	I'm warning you, Vera, you'll get what's coming to you! You're just a coward who's scared that she can't protect her teammates. No point in taking it out on us...	1

240	240		301								No. 21	Fight? I'm good at fighting.	2																					
241	241		301								Vera	Aren't you worried about getting discarded? Stick with me, and you just might.	1
