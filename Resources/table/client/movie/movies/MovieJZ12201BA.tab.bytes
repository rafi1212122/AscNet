5	5		301			DialogEnable						White smoke bursts out of the Cerberus lounge door the moment it is opened.																						
6	6		301									Vera cannot help but let out a few coughs. She frowns at the dust on the hem of her outfit, then brushes away more smoke and dust that keeps coming out.																						
7	7		201							1	500344		-400																					
8	8		201							2	500360		400																					
9	9		301							1	???	Captain's back. Noctis is dead.	1																					
10	10		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	??	Rrgh... Ngh... Um...	2																					
11	11		301									Vera cannot see who is talking, but she is very familiar with the voices.																						
12	12		202							1	2				1																			
13	13		201							1	500168																							
14	14		301							1	Vera	Is anyone still alive? Tell me what the heck you did here.	1																					
15	15		301									A white figure rushes out from the smoke. She tries to shake away the dust, looking no different to a little animal.																						
16	16		203							1	0.25	400																						
17	17		201							2	500328	4	-400																					
18	18		301							1	No. 21	Captain, Noctis was making dangerous explosives in the lounge, but Buddy and I got him under control.	2																					
19	19		202							1	2				1																			
20	20		301									Meanwhile, a red-haired man walks out of the smoke as if nothing has happened. A small robot is tightly grabbing onto his face, looking almost like a stylish gas mask.																						
21	21		201							1	500360																							
22	22		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Noctis	Rrgh... Ngh...	1																					
23	23		201							1	500168		400																					
24	24		201							2	500328	4	-400																					
25	25		301							1	Vera	What is he saying?	1																					
26	26		301								No. 21	Noctis is saying, "I'm sorry, it's my bad."	2																					
27	27		202							1	2				1																			
28	28		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiFogNew.prefab																							
29	29		301									Noctis has to rip the hyperactive robotâ€”or "Co-Bot", to be preciseâ€”off his face so he can finally talk.																						
30	30		201							1	500336	4																						
31	31		301							1	Noctis	God dammit, No. 21! What I said was the bottles only exploded because you were interfering!	1																					
32	32		502						200	PanelActor1Shake																								
33	33		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
34	34		301									No. 21 is making threatening growls, but Noctis simply does not care, which results in another brawl with the Co-Bot.																						
35	35		201							1	500168																							
36	36		301							1	Vera	I don't give a crap about what you are doing, but you better not do it too loud... This damn place comes with a lot of rules.	1																					
37	37		202							1	2				1																			
38	38		301									No matter how problematic they were before joining Babylonia, the three of them are now members of Cerberus, a squad that is only recently established but has already become well-known in ways both good and bad.																						
39	39		301									Vera kicks away the tables before opening her own locker. She quickly performs basic maintenance on her equipment.																						
40	40		201							1	500168		400																					
41	41		201							2	500328		-400																					
42	42		301							1	No. 21	Is there a mission, Captain?	2																					
43	43		301								Vera	It has nothing to do with you. They only asked me.	1																					
44	44		301									No. 21 cluelessly looks at Vera and feels a bit hesitant. Recently, Vera would sometimes go on missions alone, and the results of those missions would not be recorded in any form.																						
45	45		204							2	3																							
46	46		301								No. 21	Am I... is Noctis dragging you down?	2																					
47	47		201							1	500336		400																					
48	48		301								Noctis	What are you talking about, idiot? You and this stupid robot are the ones dragging me and Vera down!	1																					
49	49		502						200	PanelActor1Shake																								
50	50		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
51	51		301									Noctis taunts and screams while trying to dodge the Co-Bot, only to get clawed on the back of his head two seconds later.																						
52	52		301								Noctis	I swear I'm going to blow this thing up this time!	1																					
53	53		204							2	4																							
54	54		301								No. 21	Don't lose to him, Buddy!	2																					
55	55		202							1	2				1																			
56	56		401							2	647																							
57	57		301									Vera has already disappeared before the two of them clash again. She has not gone far, only leaning on the door with her eyes closed, listening to the quarrel that seems to have become a part of their daily life.																						
58	58		301									When Vera's hand reaches the cold katana handle, she slowly opens her eyes, once again regaining the coldness in them, and walks toward her next destination without looking back.																						
59	59		201							1	500168																							
60	60		401							1	36																							
61	61		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Vera	What I need to do was decided long ago...	1

64	64		401							1	45																							
65	65		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Vera steps into Nikola's office, only to find another Construct inside with him. She makes an annoyed "tsk" and is about to leave.																						
66	66		201							1	500012																							
67	67		301							1	Nikola	Where are you going? Come back. We're about to go.	1																					
68	68		301									Cerberus works directly under Nikola, so most of their missions are highly classified. She seldom receives support from other squads and members. In particular, this type of special "assignment" is kept strictly to herself.																						
69	69		201							1	500168	13																						
70	70		301							1	Vera	Hah, are you sure...?	1																					
71	71		301									Vera takes a glimpse at the Construct and realizes she has never seen him before. Nikola nods in return.																						
72	72		201							1	500348	1																						
73	73		301							1	???	Hello, you must be Miss Vera. I am...	1																					
74	74		202							1	2				1																			
75	75		301									Vera ignores his handshake. She finds an empty chair and sits on it instead. The other Construct pulls his hand back in embarrassment.																						
76	76		201							1	500012		400																					
77	77		201							2	500168		-400																					
78	78		301							1	Vera	...Fine, you are going to take the responsibility anyway.	2																					
79	79		301								Nikola	That's not for you to worry about... To get you up to speed, this is Lloyd. He will be coming along with you this time.	1																					
80	80		301								Vera	This guy...? Where does this handsome toff come from?	2																					
81	81		301									Vera frowns as she scrutinizes Lloyd, who looks way too well-presented for the dirty, chaotic battlefield.																						
82	82		301								Vera	I told you a long time ago... I don't need any help. I can do this on my own.	2																					
83	83		301								Nikola	Don't get me wrong. This is not a discussion. Your only option is to accept it.	1																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		201							1	500348																							
86	86		301							1	Lloyd	I'm not a "toff," Miss Vera. Just like you, I am a soldier of Babylonia.	1																					
87	87		301									Thanks to Vera's "assignments," she has almost remembered the names of all Construct soldiers in the file. But she has never seen himâ€”the name "Lloyd", however, does sound a little familiar.																						
88	88		201							1	500168																							
89	89		301							1	Vera	Lloyd... Loy...	1																					
90	90		202							1	2				1																			
91	91		301									There is a rumor of a Construct named "Lloyd" among Babylonia soldiers. He is an ordinary soldier just like them, but is said to have superior strength and an extremely impressive track record.																						
92	92		301									Most importantly, he can always survive using the "Recall" technology no matter how dire the situation is. Time after time, he would return to the frontline. Others see him as a hero of Babylonia and call him "The Undying Loy".																						
93	93		201							1	500012		400																					
94	94		201							2	500168		-400																					
95	95		301							1	Nikola	You have probably figured out who he is, so I'm going to skip the introduction.	1																					
96	96		301									Vera used to laugh at the rumor, but now the legendary hero is right next to her.																						
97	97		204							2	13																							
98	98		301								Vera	The undying "hero" teaming up with "Death"... Interesting.	2																					
99	99		201							1	500348		400																					
100	100		301								Lloyd	Miss Vera...?	1																					
101	101		204							2	1																							
102	102		301								Vera	You look a lot less intelligent than the rumors suggest.	2																					
103	103		301									Before Lloyd can ask, Vera has already picked up her weapon.																						
104	104		301								Vera	Whatever, let's go, "hero"... Nikola will send the mission detail to our terminals.	2																					
105	105		301									Lloyd looks at Nikola, who is apparently annoyed by Vera's attitude but still makes a hand signal, asking him to follow.																						
106	106		202							1	2				1																			
107	107		401							2	1515																							
108	108		301									After both Lloyd and Vera are gone, Nikola looks back at the holographic screen with a global tactical map displayed on it.																						
109	109		201							1	500012																							
110	110		301							1	Nikola	Lloyd must continue to be the "hero" that he is supposed to be.	1																					
111	111		401							2	556																							
112	112		401					500		2	556																							
113	113		401					200		2	556																							
114	114		301									The situation of the Task Forces all around the globe is displayed live on the map. The screen is flooded with notices showing the deaths and losses of Construct soldiers. The information is so basic that even their names are omittedâ€”a simple ID and a time stamp are all they have.																						
115	115		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nikola	No matter how he does it, or how high the price is...	1
