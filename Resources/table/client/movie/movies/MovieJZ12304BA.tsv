6	6		301								Mandhasti	Roland, what's wrong? What's with the daydreaming?	1																					
7	7		204							2																								
8	8		301								Roland	...Huh? Oh.	2																					
9	9		204							1																								
10	10		301								Mandhasti	Are you all right? We have to investigate the address on the document. It's too dangerous to be daydreaming at a time like this.	1																					
11	11		301								Roland	Sorry, zoned out there for a second. I'm fine. Don't worry about me.	2																					
12	12		301								Mandhasti	...Alright.	1																					
13	13		301									Mandhasti leans against the street wall and scratches his cheek. Roland faces the road, as if observing the traffic, but his eyes are on the simulated sunlight, forcing himself not to fall asleep.																						
14	14		301									Suddenly, Mandhasti pats him on the shoulder.																						
15	15		301								Mandhasti	Hey... When this mission is over, how about I give you some time off?	1																					
16	16		204							2	4																							
17	17		301								Roland	Why?	2																					
18	18		301								Mandhasti	Every time I've seen you recently, you've seemed distraught. You haven't been acting yourself recently. But not like you're under pressure from the mission.	1																					
19	19		301								Mandhasti	I'm not sure if it's something I did, but I understand if you don't want to tell me.	1																					
20	20		301								Mandhasti	Maybe it's just a king being overly worried about his knight. Maybe you'll feel better after some time to yourself. What do you say?	1

24	24		301								Roland	R-really? Thank you so much—	2																					
25	25		301									Not out of the script, but out of sincere concern. It's even more confusing.																						
26	26		301									Right as he raises his hand to thank Mandhasti as usual, his sights first fall on a short baton.																						
27	27		204							2	7																							
28	28		301									It's the same EMP baton he used to knock Mandhasti unconscious yesterday. His hand becomes all sweaty from gripping it.																						
29	29		301									He feels like, as soon as he lets go, Mandhasti will find out something's wrong and begin questioning him again.																						
30	30		204							2	2																							
31	31		301								Roland	...Uh, I just remembered that I left something at the station. I'll see you around.	2																					
32	32		202							2					2																			
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland takes a few steps back and starts running before Mandhasti can respond.																						
34	34		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory314.png																								
35	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Just around the corner, a crew member he knows is on standby.																						
36	36		201							1	500382																							
37	37		301							1	Neferti	Going off script now? But you rarely do that. What's wrong?	1

39	39		201							2	500365	4	-400																					
40	40		301							1	Roland	I forgot some of the new script from last night. I need to go over my lines. Just give me 8 minutes.	2																					
41	41		301								Roland	The script also left some leeway in it. The next scene is the investigation set on M1L. Use the extras to buy some time until I come back. Don't worry, I'll finish the scene.	2																					
42	42		301								Neferti	Understand. I'll get right on it.	1																					
43	43		202							1	2				1																			
44	44		301									Watching Neferti run off, Roland looks for a patch of shade. After confirming that Mandhasti is nowhere to be seen, he huddles up on the ground.																						
45	45		201							1	500365	17																						
46	46		301							1	Roland	If... he starts going crazy again... Then I'll... get him with the EMP from behind...	1																					
47	47		301								Roland	No, no, no. Now's not the time to be thinking about that. We've already taken enough precautions. The higher-ups screened all the extras and rewrote the script yesterday.	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	I've got plenty of backup if that happens again.	1																					
49	49		204							1	1																							
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	There won't be any problems... There won't. Believe in yourself, Roland. Everyone believes in you. You're a professional. This isn't your first rodeo. Get ahold of yourself, just this once...	1																					
51	51		204							1	17																							
52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					...																						
53	53		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Drowsiness and anxiety pound on his overly caffeinated brain.																						
54	54		301									Falling asleep in the middle of his performance would be a disaster, one which he needs to avoid at all costs.																						
55	55		301									He pinches a nerve and forces himself to hang in there. Right as his head drops, he catches himself. He struggles as he drifts in and out of sleep as if deliberately torturing himself.																						
56	56		204							1	1																							
57	57		301								Roland	Heck, I don't even dare sleep because every time I do, something happens. I downed a bunch of espresso before the performance, but it doesn't seem to be working.	1																					
58	58		301								Roland	...Guess I'll relax and check some data.	1																					
59	59		401							2	1515																							
60	60		301									Finally tired of dealing with his internal struggle, he grabs the terminal next to him. Looking at the time, there is still enough time for him to catch up on new data for today.																						
61	61		301								Roland	Let's see... How's everyone doing today? Wow, daily activity is at 10997108%. Hahaha, that's awesome...	1																					
62	62		301								Roland	As if we'd ever get numbers that high. What, even aliens tuned in to watch our show?	1																					
63	63		301								Roland	This machine is always on the fritz... Oh well...	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									Roland shakes his head and stands in a beam of sunlight. He closes his eyes and tries to hear the subtle sound of the autofocusers around him. He does not feel like he is in the sun, but rather standing beneath an array of countless cameras.																						
66	66		301									He has not looked carefully at the park's setting in quite some time. Even though the prop team deliberately aged the city, if you look more closely, you can see that everything is made of state-of-the-art material. Combined with the high-end cameras camouflaged in the back drop, the set forms a modern city.																						
67	67		301									He has spent half of his life in this fake city.																						
68	68		301									He has no regrets because he has a clear goal. He will pursue that goal to the end.																						
69	69		301									Even if he stumbles all the way, he has made it this far. As long as he can endure for a few more years, he will be able to live the life he dreams of spending with his family.																						
70	70		301			RImgBg1Shake					Neferti	Sector M1L actors in position! Roland, Roland!																						
71	71		301									Just as Roland's thoughts are about to wander out of the city and to his distant family, the familiar voice pulls him back to reality.																						
72	72		201							1	500365	4																						
73	73		301							1	Roland	...Here.	1																					
74	74		204							1	4																							
75	75		301								Roland	Oh... The script. Gotta go over the script...	1																					
76	76		301									Yesterday's episode was interrupted by Mandhasti's intense round of questioning. After the recap, he returned to the detention center. This morning, he released Mandhasti from the detention center and began investigating problems with the gang.																						
77	77		301									After that, he needs to guide Mandhasti into continuing to doubt the authenticity of the world around him. Then he needs to snatch a police knife from Mandhasti's hand and slash his own wrist.																						
78	78		301									Of course, the knife is not dangerous. It is only plastic. However, whenever the special coating comes into contact with skin, it melts into the color of blood.																						
79	79		301									He'll use his "blood" to bring Mandhasti to his senses. According to the writer, the idea comes from a legend about a knight who sacrificed himself to pull the king out of danger.																						
80	80		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Okay. Script memorized. It's showtime.	1																					
81	81		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory424.jpg																								
82	82		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland pats his cheeks and takes his position.																						
83	83		301								Roland	After this segment, "Roland" will be temporarily hospitalized for mental trauma and self-harm.	1																					
84	84		301								Roland	That'll give me some time to have a break and rest up.	1																					
85	85		204							1	2																							
86	86		301								Roland	I can have another good talk with Rolmo and the folks.	1																					
87	87		204							1	1																							
88	88		301								Roland	Hurry up and put an end to this. Please...	1																					
89	89		301									After quietly encouraging himself, Roland looks up and faces the place where Mandhasti should appear.																						
90	90		301									Several figures come running from that direction. Screws and wires poke out of their ragged clothes. Judging from the costumes, they appear to be extras from the park.																						
91	91		204							1	7																							
92	92		301								Roland	...Huh?	1																					
93	93		301									One or two of them, which seem to be mechanoids, run toward Roland. Looking from a distance, Roland can see a glimmer of red light in their eyes.																						
94	94		201							1	500013		400																					
95	95		201							2	500013		-400

100	100		301							1	Roland	...Hey! What are you doing! We're shooting a scene here! You guys are up next...	1

102	102		401							1	202																							
103	103		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		Roland's cry is cut off mid-sentence as he suddenly sees a dark object flying right at him. He sidesteps the object, which flies by in a flash of silver and clangs onto the ground.																						
104	104		301								Roland	What was that?! A wrench?! Who threw that?!	1																					
105	105		301									It's a wrench commonly used for repairing mechanoids. Given the speed, a direct hit would've killed anyone right then and there.																						
106	106		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Roland	What the hell are you doing?! You're gonna get someone killed!	1																					
107	107		301								Roland	Rgh! Hey! [Beep] you, knock it off!	1																					
108	108		204							1	4																							
109	109		301								Roland	Director! Director! Say something already!	1																					
110	110		401							2	613																							
111	111		301									He kneels down and takes shelter. Turning on his earpiece to call for support, all he hears is radio silence. The earpiece, which normally relays instructions, is nothing but static.																						
112	112		402							613																								
113	113		204							1	4																							
114	114		301								Roland	Director? Director... Hmph, what's wrong? How can it break at a time like this?!	1																					
115	115		202							1					1																			
116	116		301									Looking out from the side of the shelter, he sees one of the lead mechanoids rush toward him...																						
117	117		201							1	500013																							
118	118		301							1	Mechanoid	Urgh—!	1																					
119	119		201							1	500365	7																						
120	120		301							1	Roland	Wait, is that... the old punch-in bot?	1																					
121	121		301									Ragged clothes and makeup that spells old age. Roland quickly recognizes that the security mechanoid dressed as an old man guarding the door to Roland's room is the one attacking him.																						
122	122		301									That mechanoid should be guarding the door to prevent Mandhasti from wandering into important areas, or at least assisting the crew in the lounge... In any case, it shouldn't be here with those glaring red eyes.																						
123	123		204							1	4																							
124	124		301								Roland	Looking at the others running rampart, they also appear to be mechanoids based on their robotic movement.	1																					
125	125		301								Roland	What's wrong with those mechanoids? Did they all of sudden rewrite the show into a zombie apocalypse? What about the other mechanoids?	1																					
126	126		301									He ducks behind a nearby wall. A heavy object flies toward Roland and hits the corner of the wall, knocking out several steel parts. A gap appears in the set's camouflage.																						
127	127		301								Roland	Hmph. If the director's not gonna tell me what to do, guess I gotta play it by ear... I gotta get out of here before I'm really in danger.	1																					
128	128		301								Roland	Think all after all those chase scenes, I can't outrun you?	1																					
129	129		301								Roland	The nearest work area is in Sector H7M... Alright, that's where I'll go!	1																					
130	130		301									He quickly thinks over the route, then takes off running. As expected, the mechanoids behind him aren't that fast. A hail of sharp objects misses his heels, and they ended the pursuit shortly after.																						
131	131		301								Roland	Of course... Gotta get Mandy out of here.	1																					
132	132		301								Roland	Forget about the crazy mechanoids for now. If Mandy sees this... I really don't want to beat him with that baton again.	1																					
133	133		204							1	1																							
134	134		301								Roland	Haha, even in crisis and I don't know what's going on, I can't forget the king. I guess I really am like a knight...	1																					
135	135		301								Roland	"I can't protect you out there, but at least I can in here. I want to keep you safe."—At least, if I were "Roland", I'd probably say something like that. Ha!	1																					
136	136		301									Roland mulls over some lines, shakes his head and smiles. As he follows his established route, he turns the street corner and sees a familiar figure in front of him.																						
137	137		204							1	4																							
138	138		301								Roland	Mandy! Over here! We gotta go!	1																					
139	139		301								Roland	No time to explain! We need to run! Our lives are in danger!	1																					
140	140		201							1	500378																							
141	141		301							1		Roland rushed forward and grabs Mandhasti by the wrist, his smile firm yet sincere.																						
142	142		201							1	500365	4																						
143	143		301							1	Roland	Don't worry, I'll protect you. After all, I'm your knight.	1																					
144	144		301									That's right. Run first, then find a secluded area to calm Mandy down. Once the crew resolves the issue with the extras, they'll come to get the king.																						
145	145		301									Just like usual, he'll rely on his skills as an actor. Then...																						
146	146		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiHitNew.prefab	2																							
147	147		301			RImgBg1Shake						But then... as Mandy raises the knife into the air, Roland's sights are covered in red.																						
148	148		204							1	7																							
149	149		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Roland	Huh?	1

151	151		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		Roland takes a few steps back. Bright red liquid drips from the corner of his clothes. There isn't a wound, only bright red dye on his soaked jacket.																						
152	152		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryJianXue.prefab																							
153	153		301								Roland	Why?	1																					
154	154		301									Why? The script should've had him take Mandhasti to a safe place and guard him until the problem was solved. That's when he'd take his knife and he'd be the one to use it.																						
155	155		301									But then why is his chest covered in red dye? Was something wrong with his acting? Did he give something away?																						
156	156		301									Roland looks up at the Mandhasti's intense red eyes. His gaze is devoid of any realistic quality capable of deceiving the audience. It is... ruthless.																						
157	157		204							1	17																							
158	158		301								Roland	...Sector M1L. All cameras offline!	1																					
159	159		301									Calm down. Just calm down. All the cameras are pointed right this way. We need to cut the broadcast and get the situation under control.																						
160	160		204							1	4																							
161	161		301								Roland	Neferti! Screenwriter?! The director isn't responding! Help me take care of this!	1																					
162	162		301									No response. No one is in the building, which should've been filled with the crew.																						
163	163		301									Roland looks around in a daze as Mandhasti approaches him step by step. As his figure draws near, the hidden cameras begin to glow red one by one.																						
164	164		301									Red, red, red. He is surrounded by bright red light.																						
165	165		301									In front of him, Mandhasti raises the dagger and slashes at him again—																						
166	166		201							1	500378																							
167	167		401							2	1508																							
168	168		301							1	Mandhasti	Urgh—!

170	170		201							1	500365	4																						
171	171		301							1	Roland	...!	1																					
172	172		401							2	1512																							
173	173		301									Narrowly dodging the dagger, he grabs the baton from his waist, activates the EMP, and hits him full-force.																						
174	174		401							2	1513																							
175	175		301									Mandhasti crumples to the ground. Roland looks out to the spreading red light. He hears them running rampant.																						
176	176		204							1	17																							
177	177		301								Roland	Huff... Puff...	1																					
178	179		301									Without hesitation, he charges in the direction with the least amount of red light. He has nowhere else to run.																						
179	180		301								Roland	What the heck is going on?	1																					
180	181		301								Roland	If this is a part of the script, someone yell cut and run another take!	1																					
181	182		204							1	7																							
182	183		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	But if it isn't... Then... What am I supposed to do?	1
