3	3		301			DialogEnable						The next morning, all the remaining soldiers of Base 068 safely arrived at the nearest depot.																						
4	4		301									I risked being demoted and gave my commander a guarantee to put together a Construct army toward Base 068.																						
5	5		301									I told him we left lots of supplies that needed to be retrieved. There might also be survivors who didn't manage to retreat in time.																						
6	6		301									I honestly don't believe it myself. What creature can survive a legion of Corrupted for one night on a deserted battlefield?																						
7	7		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					If there is a miracle, no matter how late, I would like to witness it.																						
8	8		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory462.jpg

11	11		301							1	Construct Soldier	Push forward!	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									The scattered team continues to move forward. Suddenly, a soldier holding a detector stops and looks to the front in suspicion.																						
14	14		401							2	1515																							
15	15		201							1	500019																							
16	16		301							1	Construct Soldier	Wait... Isn't this area already abandoned? Why are there so many life signals?	1

22	22		301									I quickly take over his detector. It beeps louder as I walk forward.																						
23	23		401							2	561																							
24	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I walk to a mostly collapsed wall and pull the scrapped door open.

27	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The sun shines into the cramped space. Dozens of wounded soldiers lie exhausted in this room. Some have lost limbs or suffered great trauma, some are already showing signs of infection after the CPF stopped functioning. But they are all alive.																						
28	28		201							1	500019																							
29	29		301							1	Construct Soldier	Reporting to HQ, we've found...	1																					
30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301									The still-conscious soldiers turn to me. A ray of sunlight shines upon their faces. I see hope in their eyes.

35	35		301							1	Soldiers	It's real... Someone has come for us...	1																					
36	36		301									Gloomy Face is also there. He slumps on the ground ahead, still holding a half-empty bottle of hemostatic potionâ€”he was probably helping to treat the other soldiers. The medic huddles among the soldiers. She is dead quiet, I can't even tell if she is still alive.																						
37	37		301								Gloomy Face	She's alive...	3																					
38	38		202							1	2	3			1																			
39	39		301									He makes that annoying smile again.

42	42		201							1	500019																							
43	43		301							1	Construct Soldier	Roger that! One heavily wounded medic, and... 35 treated soldiers...	1																					
44	44		301								Construct Soldier	Please send in the medical unit ASAP!	1																					
45	45		301								Construct Soldier	They were all... treated by this one medic?	1																					
46	46		301								Construct Soldier	Quick... We have to save her.	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									The Construct soldiers immediately start moving. I ask them to move out those with less severe injuries first.																						
49	49		201							1	500409	5																						
50	50		301							1	Yelena	Leave her alone for now. She's got multiple compound fractures.	1																					
51	51		301								Medic	...																						
52	52		301									She seems to have heard me as her eye lashes move slightly. I quickly squat next to her.																						
53	53		301								Medic	...Officer... Yelena? Is that you?																						
54	54		204							1	7																							
55	55		301								Yelena	...You're a fool. This is a serious violation of discipline.	1																					
56	56		301									She barely pulls a smile. Her eyes are still closed.																						
57	57		301								Medic	...It's so good... to have you here...																						
58	58		202							1					1																			
59	59		301									She becomes silent again, but I can still detect her life signals. I stand up again and notice Gloomy Face on his feet already, holding crutches. I walk straight to him and pull him out of the door.																						
60	61		201							1	500409	5	-300																					
61	62		201							2	500408	19	300																					
62	63		301							1	Yelena	Why did you run?	1																					
63	64		301								Gloomy Face	...	2																					
64	65		301								Yelena	Why did you run?	1																					
65	66		301									He looks away and his lips start to tremble. I already know the answer.																						
66	67		203						25	2	0.1	400																						
67	68		203							2	0.1	400	-75																					
68	69		301									I release his collar. He stumbles.																						
69	70		301								Yelena	Then why did you let her save your life? Aren't you ashamed?	1																					
70	71		301								Gloomy Face	I'm sorry...	2																					
71	72		301								Yelena	This is a war. It doesn't need your apology.	1																					
72	73		301									I want to keep my promise and shoot him. He starts to sob like a coward, his head buried between his shoulders. He then starts to stammer with great determination.																						
73	74		301								Gloomy Face	Please, execute me... I'm a deserter. I would have died back there if not for her...	2																					
74	75		301								Gloomy Face	I will... take responsibility. I don't want to run again...	2																					
75	76		202							1	2				1																			
76	77		301									I close my eyes and inhale a deep breath.																						
77	78		201							1	500409	5	-300																					
78	79		201							2	500408	19	400																					
79	80		301							1	Yelena	...All deserters will be expunged from the army and must never enter any jurisdiction of the World Government. Now, get lost before you piss me off further.	1																					
80	81		301								Gloomy Face	...Why?	2																					
81	82		301								Yelena	She risked her life saving you. Twice. I respect her decision as a medic.	1																					
82	83		301									I watch him burst into tears apathetically.																						
83	84		301								Gloomy Face	Sorry... I'm so sorry...	2																					
84	85		202							1	2				1																			
85	86		301									He clumsily bends down to pick up his crutches.																						
86	87		301									After getting back on his feet, he wipes his face and looks me in the eye for the first time.																						
87	88		201							1	500409		-450																					
88	89		201							2	500408	19	450																					
89	90		301							1	Gloomy Face	I will live on... She saved my life...	2																					
90	91		301								Gloomy Face	I'm a coward... but the words she told me gave me the courage to live...	2

96	97		301									He limps out, mumbling to himself.																						
97	98		201							1	500409	5																						
98	99		301							1	Yelena	Hey, Gloomy Face.	1																					
99	100		301									I stop him again.																						
100	101		301								Yelena	What did she say to you?	1																					
101	102		202							1																								
102	103		301								Gloomy Face	When she was treating me, she said...																						
103	104		301									He tries to recite every word she said last night.																						
104	105		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gloomy Face	Humanity was bred from such destruction...																						
105	106		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz2801.jpg																								
106	107		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Medic	Remember the question you asked me...? "Should we humans embrace our destiny of destruction?"																						
107	108		301								Medic	I thought about it for a long time.																						
108	109		301								Medic	I am just as lost as you, with no place to go back to, and do not know where to go either. I'm just drifting about in the doomsday.																						
109	110		301								Medic	But when I was looking at the stars tonight, I suddenly understood...																						
110	111		301								Medic	...Humanity was bred from such destruction.																						
111	112		301								Medic	We are all unique. No matter how hard life treats you, you will have your own way to shine.																						
112	113		301								Medic	There is always hope, as long as we are alive.																						
113	114		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Medic	So my answer is, please try your best to live every day to the fullest. I may not have a home to go back to, but other soldiers still do... The things and people they love are still waiting for them.																						
114	115		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory18.jpg																								
115	116		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin				Gloomy Face	...That was her answer.																						
116	117		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory462.jpg																								
117	118		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...It all makes sense. How could I not understand?																						
118	119		301									Didn't she give me hope when she first stepped on the battlefield?																						
119	120		301									When she reaches out to every badly wounded soldier, isn't she spreading her faith?																						
120	121		301									When I pulled the door open, I saw light on the faces of those soldiers. It was their resurrection.																						
121	122		301									No matter what vessel holds her soul, her spirit cannot be concealed. She is a light that shines in the darkness, a spark in this dark and desperate age.																						
122	123		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I watched him leave. An egret lands on the top of the ruins under the sun, making a long and peaceful chirp.																						
123	124		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
124	125		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The hope she gave me is still passed down through the troops I lead. Most of the soldiers she rescued managed to survive, and they continue to follow me.																						
125	126		301									Later on, the World Government began to implement Construct technologies on a large scale and established formal Construct armies that reported to the World Government directly. I had been assigned to the Task Force.																						
126	127		301									I never met her again, but I heard that she had also become a Construct in the end.																						
127	128		301									I still talk about her in front of the rookies. But this time, she is still alive, fighting for mankind somewhere in this world.																						
128	129		301									As the Punishing Virus continued to evolve, mankind faced even greater challenges. I hate to admit, but when my squad was sent to the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, that battle was the most difficult one I had ever fought.																						
129	130		301									Each time, after my squad suffered a great loss from Hetero-Creatures, I would be re-assigned to another squad that had lost their captain. The cycle continued indefinitely.																						
130	131		301									When my body finally failed to function, I was overwhelmed by Hetero-Sapiens. Somehow, I started to miss that medic in my blurred M.I.N.D.																						
131	132		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It's been too long, and I have fought too many battles. I feel like I have seen her, but she is nothing like what I remember.																						
132	133		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2301_4.jpg																								
133	135		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Yelena	...â–¡â–¡â–¡?																						
134	136		301									I try to endure the agonizing pain and call her name. It's slightly comforting knowing that at least I'm not quoting her name as one of my deceased soldiers... But not much better. I think I'm dying.																						
135	137		301									She is right above me, glowing like a goddess that descends from the sky. I see a compassionate smile with a hint of sadness on her face. Just like one of those symbolic statues in churches. She gazes upon me like a sacred mother looking at her newborn, so devout, loving, and kind.																						
136	138		301									I feel a little confused. Is that her? Or am I seeing an angel because I'm dying?																						
137	139		301									She gently waves her scepter. A soothing wave flows over my M.I.N.D., drawing away the pain, as well as the raging, desperate scream of my soldiers.																						
138	140		301									I no longer feel desperate or painful. If this is what death is, I must thank the God for making it so peaceful, though I have never seen him.																						
139	141		301								Yelena	If you are an angel... Please, save my soldiers too. And that medic... Please bless her so she can survive.																						
140	142		301									I mutter to myself as I think of my soldiers. Those brave and poor souls... The scenes of their deaths gradually fade away in my vision. I feel like I have returned to my hometown, surrounded by family and friends. We drink and build a bonfire on the snow while fending off wild bears from the forest.																						
141	143		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					I close my eyes and indulge myself in deep, comforting dreams with peace of mind.
