4	4		304							The writing has since been going... smoothly, more or less. I'm afraid I don't have more updates regarding it right now.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
5	5		304							To compensate, I've attached a funny thing that happened during the writing process.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

8	8		304							I've seen you smile, but it was always a polite smile before your mother or other guests.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
9	9		304							Even I have rarely seen you smile comfortably as yourself.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

11	11		304							Not long after you became a Construct and joined the Archaeological Team, you helped restore an opera from a composer in the Golden Age.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
12	12		304							You couldn't wait to contact me the moment you finished listening to that old performance.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
13	13		304							And when I saw that beautiful, bright smile on your face... that was the real thing.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
14	14		304							You smiled as you told me how much you were enjoying the opera, how it still lingered with you.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
15	15		304							You were wondering who this composer was and for what reason this person joined the fight.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
16	16		304							You were thinking about how you would tell him what his work meant to you.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

30	30		301									This area is too barren to be called a city ruin, but the echoes of past civilizations mean this is no wilderness either.																						
31	31		301									This is one of the ruins of the Great Evacuation evacuation site. A large battle took place here a few weeks ago.

35	35		301									I was just... considering where to start.																						
36	36		301									She then looks at the colors-covered ground. She is not sure if it is the work of someone or nature, but a sea of flowers has blossomed on the war-ravaged field.																						
37	37		301								Selena	A few of the petals have been crushed, leaving behind small footprints.	1																					
38	38		301								Selena	...I'm also looking for a girl named Flora. I heard she left the conservation area for a while now. She will likely get infected in this area with a low Punishing Virus concentration.	1

52	52		301								Selena	Selena smiles, walking forward along the wall Pieter was pointing, looking further beyond where the stone wall lies.	2																					
53	53		301								Selena	Look. This is a standard pattern you'd find in a large gallery right before the main hall.	2																					
54	54		301									Flora would have recognized it and headed for the gallery. And she would...																						
55	55		301								Selena	Selena points to one side of the stone wall.	2																					
56	56		301								Pieter	...Head that way.	1																					
57	57		301								Selena	You looked into Florance's girl?	2																					
58	58		301								Selena	I simply asked around among the children. They told me that Flora is a well-known art-lover in conservation area 184.	2																					
59	59		301								Selena	She has left behind paintings and notes about her dreams and the stories she wants to tell. Clearly, Florance taught her much.	2																					
60	60		301								Selena	Now that she has "run away"... to somewhere fairly concentrated with the Punishing Virus away from the conservation area and is nowhere to be found.	2																					
61	61		301								Selena	It was because of what her mother did.	2																					
62	62		301								Selena	After Flora's mother heard about her husband's death, she threw away most of his work in a moment of grief, while Flora collected them back... again and again. Eventually, she left with those work without anyone noticing.	2																					
63	63		301								Selena	Flora would have left with complicated feelings, hoping to find a way to save her grieving mother. She might not have a destination in mind... but when she reached here, she must have slowed down for the ruins as an art-lover.	2																					
64	64		301								Selena	She might be wondering what these places looked like in the past.	2																					
65	65		301									This could have been a supple field where wheat, barley, rye, wild beans, and peas flourish.																						
66	66		301								Selena	She lifts her hand to her waist, opening her palm as if the crops she mentioned are really here, and she is touching them.	2																					
67	67		301								Pieter	These could have been the turfy mountains where the sheep nibble, the flat meads thatched with stover, and the banks with pioned and twilled brims.	1																					
68	68		301									But this is nothing now.																						
69	69		301								Selena	In an instant, Pieter's words take away the crops and the fields, leaving behind the barren land and the few shrubs that are there.	2																					
70	70		301								Pieter	Right... my apologies.	1

78	78		301								Selena	Speaking of which, do you know what the most famous painting among these ruins was?	1																					
79	79		301									This used to be a gallery, and that painting used to be hung here.																						
80	80		301								Selena	Deep within the ruins, Selena suddenly stops and gestures toward an empty wall next to her.	1																					
81	81		301									It was a long painting of a starry sky. It could have stretched from this end to the other, covering the whole wall. The artist painted it while threatened by hunger and cold.																						
82	82		301								Selena	Selena touches the wall, her fingers gently gliding over the rough surface as if the painting is still there before her, meeting her fingertips.	1																					
83	83		301								Selena	I still remember how shocked I was when I first saw it.	1																					
84	84		301								Selena	The sun above our head has been shining upon us for billions of years.	1																					
85	85		301								Selena	Who knows how many lightyears those stars had to travel to arrive here?	1																					
86	86		301								Pieter	This planet is like an eye... and wherever it looks, it is enveloped by the light from the sun.	2

90	90		301								Selena	Selena smiles, seemingly having found a rare person who understands her.	1																					
91	91		301								Selena	A correction, then. There isn't just an eye in the universe—there are also gazes. Perhaps one day in the future, ours will meet the gaze of another star.	1																					
92	92		301								Selena	When that happens, we could very well communicate with each other, but the method might be unconventional and ineffective... like writing letters?	1																					
93	93		301								Pieter	What do you think? Pieter?	2

98	98		301							1	Pieter	But I must correct you on one thing—aliens might be a little too far away from us. Even if we could establish communication, it would take too long. We wouldn't have time to translate their language before our civilizations are gone and vice versa.																						
99	99		204							2																								
100	100		301								Selena	The distance of time, is it? Right... it is a shame, then. But even lost civilizations leave behind traces. They would have a long time to appreciate the marks we left behind.	1

106	106		301								Selena	Whether it's done through brushes, words, or other media, that expression offered to the world is art.	1																					
107	107		301								Selena	—Just like how the starry night was expressed in the painting even when the artist was starving and freezing.	1																					
108	108		301								Selena	Artists work tirelessly to leave behind these marks to share their thoughts with others, even across time itself. Hunger and cold would not stop them when they would sacrifice themselves for art.	1																					
109	109		301								Selena	For that, art might be as crucial to humankind as food or sleep.	1

119	119		301								Selena	Selena pauses for a moment, nodding slightly before shaking her head.	1																					
120	120		301								Selena	Hmm... I might seem too arrogant if I said "yes."	1																					
121	121		301								Selena	But... I think it is art as long as it is expressed truthfully, whether it is from a mother who gives her life to her child or soldiers who deliver a message to their comrades.	1																					
122	122		301									As for someone who thinks about art on the battlefield... I'd say that would be you, sir.																						
123	123		301								Selena	Pieter raises a brow.	1																					
124	124		301									Actually, I didn't think of this myself. I learned about it... from a scene in an opera.
