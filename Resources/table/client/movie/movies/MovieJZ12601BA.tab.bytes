7	7		301							1		The girl named Yoyo turns around with a panda plushie in her arms, nodding at her father enthusiastically.																						
8	8		301								Yoyo	Dad! This panda is called "Master", and it can talk! It can also fly...	1

10	10		201							1	500463																							
11	11		301							1	Mother	You're losing touch. You don't even know what your daughter likes! She's talking about the character in that cartoon that's popular with the kids nowadays. It's called...	1

17	17		301									A girl of a similar age walks past Yoyo with a bionic panda mechanoid in her arms. One size larger than Yoyo's plushie, it appears to be able to say the famous lines from the show—and fly, for real!																						
18	18		301								Mother	Yoyo, let your dad show off for once... And don't you want a more valuable toy that the other kids will be jealous of?	2

21	21		301							1		But Yoyo just blinks and looks at the plushie in her hands, bewildered.																						
22	22		301								Yoyo	Are cheaper toys bad? Do they have to be expensive? I don't get it...	1																					
23	23		301								Yoyo	"Master" was just an abandoned plushie in the cartoon as well. It only became a familiar because the Magical Girl's love turned into its magic power.	1																					
24	24		202							1	2				1																			
25	25		301									Yoyo's parents look at each other, seemingly surprised by what she said. They chuckle, slightly embarrassed.

27	27		201							2	500463		400

29	29		301								Father	Yeah... Yoyo doesn't care about how big or small the numbers are. Isn't that what she did in the exam? Haha!	1

33	33		301									Yoyo's father crouches down and picks up Yoyo, whose cheeks puff out, and the plushie in her hands.

35	35		201							2	500463		400

37	37		301								Mother	Ugh! I'm getting goosebumps. Look at you, not feeling embarrassed at all.	2																					
38	38		301									Blushing, Yoyo's mother smiles and gently strokes her daughter's head, her gaze filled with tenderness.

63	63		301							1	???	You. Can you sit up yourself?	1																					
64	64		301									Yoyo sees a lavishly-dressed woman sitting by the window, staring at her. The woman must be the one who saved her.																						
65	65		301									She nods, moving her body from side to side while sitting up, hoping to take a look at the room. But the pain in her right arm takes her attention away.																						
66	66		301									Seeing Yoyo's expression, the woman leans forward, inspecting the wound on her arm.																						
67	67		301								???	You were well-protected, but you're still slightly infected with the Punishing Virus... We've given you a serum. You'll be fine, apart from feeling pain for a little while.	1

71	71		301									The woman seems a little astounded to be called "Miss", but she nods regardless.																						
72	72		301								Yoyo	Then do you know where the robot... the two robots who were with me are?	2																					
73	73		301									Yoyo still remembers the two robot friends who looked scary but were actually very kind. They were traveling together until they reached the incredibly large ship...																						
74	74		204							1	7																							
75	75		301								???	I don't know. You passed out from crying, and the mechanoid who took you here was taken away... There was only one of them.	1																					
76	76		301									Seeing how disappointed Yoyo looks, the woman thinks for a second before talking again.																						
77	77		204							1	4																							
78	78		301								???	...They were probably taken to be repaired. Machines... will be as good as new after they're fixed.	1																					
79	79		204							2	1																							
80	80		301								Yoyo	Is that true?! Then I just have to find Dad. Dad will help me look for them, and Mom will make them very tasty food! Hehe... I guess robots can't eat, can they?	2																					
81	81		204							2	16																							
82	82		301								Yoyo	Dad... Mom...	2																					
83	83		301									Yoyo tries to stand up, ignoring the pain in her arm, but she almost loses her balance and falls on the rocking floor.																						
84	84		301									Looking outside, she finds herself surrounded by an endless ocean. There is nothing around her but the moon and the stars—and there is no sign of anything she knew in Kowloong.																						
85	85		301								Yoyo	I... I have to find them.	2																					
86	86		301									Stumbling around, Yoyo tries to leave the room, but the woman grabs her hand.																						
87	87		301								???	It's dangerous on this ship... It's better to stay here if you're alone.	1																					
88	88		204							2																								
89	89		301								Yoyo	Then I must find them immediately! Mom and Dad have to be risking their lives to search for me... Do you know where they are, Miss?	2																					
90	90		301									The woman shakes her head, speaking only after thinking for a while.																						
91	91		401							1	201																							
92	92		204							1	4																							
93	93		301								???	You've been unconscious for seven days. They would have been here already if they were still alive...	1																					
94	94		204							1	14																							
95	95		301								???	So... they're either dead... or they've abandoned you.	1																					
96	96		301									The woman holds Yoyo's hands gently, looking into the girl's eyes with serenity.																						
97	97		301								???	Everything without value is thrown away on the Nighter... And a child on her own is a valueless burden, so...	1																					
98	98		204							2	16																							
99	99		301								Yoyo	You're lying!	2																					
100	100		301									Shivering, Yoyo interrupts the woman with clenched teeth and tears gathering in her eyes.																						
101	101		301								Yoyo	Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me! They promised to come back and get me...	2																					
102	102		301								Yoyo	I know Dad always acted like an irresponsible dummy, but he had never broken his promises to me!	2																					
103	103		301								Yoyo	Mom sometimes got angry for no reason, but I know she would never leave me!	2																					
104	104		301									Yoyo clutches the worn panda plushie in her hands, her tears dropping on the toy.																						
105	105		204							1	14																							
106	106		301								???	Just because a promise is important... doesn't mean it's kept.	1																					
107	107		301									Yoyo flings away the woman's hand, wiping her tear-filled eyes with her long sleeves.																						
108	108		204							2	4																							
109	109		301								Yoyo	Enough... I see it now. You must be one of the bad people Dad told me about! You're trying to trick me into staying here.	2

115	115		301								???	...	1																					
116	116		301									The woman looks at her hand that was holding Yoyo. She misses and fears the sensation of someone else's touch.

123	123		301									Looking back from its fences, however, is greeted only by the dark, roiling waves.																						
124	124		301									In the distance, people in luxurious outfits are singing and performing on a stage, their music reaching the laughing audience.																						
125	125		301								—Aria—	～See the glistening colors of a mayfly's wings.～\n～Your brief life I mourn; what does mine bring?～																						
126	126		301									The girl's small figure traveled through the brilliant colors of the night, drowning in the noises of the people's lives.

172	172		301								Jin Man	It wasn't going to let me live, of course. This tricky bastard was hiding in a corner before it leaped out and went for my throat. Well, I panicked, but then I handled it. Woosh! I flipped it over and slammed it on the ground!	1																					
173	173		301									The crowd is entertained by the shopkeeper's lively, vivid tale, not realizing that a girl has walked to the front.																						
174	174		301								Jin Man	But it's a lucky thing I had my pistol! Anyway, I started blasting. Pow! This damn thing stopped moving. Pow! Pow! I took a few more shots just to be safe. That's why there're all these bullet holes on it...	1

181	181		301								Jin Man	A mechanoid saving a human girl from the Corrupted? These machines can't even stay sane from the Punishing Virus... Did your parents not teach you not to lie? Go home if you're going to act like a baby!	1

183	183		301								Yoyo	I wasn't lying...!	2

185	185		301								Jin Man	Doesn't matter what you say. This is my ware, so I get to call it whatever I want. You're welcomed to make up any story about it if you can afford to buy it, but until then, get lost!	1																					
186	186		301									The boy sighs and shakes his head, walking up and preparing to drag Yoyo away.																						
187	187		301								Yoyo	I-I have money! I'll buy him! Dad gave me l-lots of money!	2																					
188	188		301									Yoyo takes out her wallet, holding it up high. Hearing the word "money," Jin Man's expression changes in an instant.																						
189	189		301								Jin Man	Why didn't you say so? However...	1																					
190	190		301									Seeing the amount of grubs Yoyo is desperately taking out, Jin Man does not know whether to laugh or cry.																						
191	191		301								Jin Man	You've gotta be kidding me... What do you hope to buy with these scraps? Stop messing around! I'm warning you!	1

195	195		301									Jin Man is about to throw the girl out when he suddenly comes up with a plan, and he grins.																						
196	196		301								Jin Man	Now, I know you don't have the money, but there is something more valuable than grubs on the Nighter...	1

203	203		301							1	Jin Man	That thing is the "collar". We all have one on this ship, and it holds something called "miles." The number of miles Lady Qu gave all of us to start our life on the Nighter should be enough for you to buy this Tai'E.	1																					
204	204		301									Yoyo follows Jin Man's gaze and reaches for her neck, discovering a ring that locks tightly around it.																						
205	205		301								Yoyo	"Miles"... I can buy Tai'E if I use mine?	2																					
206	206		301									Jin Man smiles maliciously and leans toward Yoyo, sending her a transaction request.																						
207	207		301								Jin Man	Of course... You can buy anything you want as long as you can pay the price.	1																					
208	208		301									Although Yoyo has no idea what "miles" mean, she knows that this is the only thing she can do for the two Tai'E mechanoids that protected her with their lives.																						
209	209		301									The collars on their necks blink and complete the transaction. At that moment, Yoyo's collar flashes bright red, and a voice resounds in her head, warning her that all her miles are consumed.

215	215		301									Meanwhile, the security mechanoids on standby nearby all begin to approach Yoyo, and the gathered crowd flees out of fear.

217	217		301								Jin Man	You really don't know? Your miles is the time you're allowed to stay on the Nighter. Once you spend it all, off the ship and into the water you go.	1																					
218	218		301									He laughs patronizingly before standing next to Yoyo and putting his hand on her shoulder.																						
219	219		301								Jin Man	Now, folks around here would pay quite a fortune to relive someone else's memories, especially someone like you, who got to live carefree in Kowloong.	1																					
220	220		301								Jin Man	If you were to sell me these memories of yours, I might be able to give you some of those miles back... Think about it. Isn't it better to let those worthless memories go and start anew on this ship?	1																					
221	221		301									To forget her father's laughter, her mother's embrace, the figure that spent its last minutes protecting her... She will not need to spend her nights chasing ghosts anymore.																						
222	222		301									But to walk into those nights all alone, much like the ship she is on sailing in solitude on the turbulent sea... Is that a future that she wants?																						
223	223		301								Yoyo	No...!	2

225	225		301									Yoyo pushes him away, knocking down a few mechanoids that try to catch her, and she dashes away, tumbling.																						
226	226		301									Jin Man falls onto the boy, pushed by Yoyo's surprising strength. Just as he is about to order his men to go after the girl, he is knocked out by a strike on the neck.

228	228		301							1	Boy	Uh-oh. Sorry, boss... I slipped.	1																					
229	229		301									The boy drags the unconscious Jin Man into a hidden corner amidst the chaos, taking out Jin Man's wallet and putting all the grubs inside into his own pocket.																						
230	230		301								Boy	Service charge, mental health claims, hazard pay, overtime... Hehe, thank you for employing my service—	1																					
231	231		301									A freezing drop of water falls on the boy's nose.

233	233		301								Boy	It's about to rain...	1																					
234	234		301									He looks in the direction Yoyo ran toward and sighs, flipping a grub before catching it.																						
235	235		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Boy	What an idiot... What do you get to keep if you die?	1
