4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Camu	I've become a Kurono soldier. Life's pretty good.	1																					
5	5		301								Camu	And...	1																					
6	6		301								Camu	Oh, right. Listen, Master, I'm gonna beat you one day.	1																					
7	7		301									At the squad's rallying point, Camu takes out his terminal and sends his mentor a message. He would prefer to talk to him directly, but Mao Zhen never picked up his calls for some reason.																						
8	8		301								Camu	Tch. What's that guy doing anyway?	1																					
9	9		301									Besides surviving, defeating his mentor is Camu's second goal. He and Mao Zhen first met on the streets...																						
10	10		301									Mistaking Mao Zhen as an easy target, Camu attacked immediately and suffered a humiliating defeat. Mao Zhen became his mentor and the one who taught Camu how to survive.																						
11	11		301								Camu	Well, leave me on read all you want. Once I prove myself, I'll find a way to see you again.	1

16	16		301							1		Camu places his greatsword back on his back. He then notices some of his companions discussing something, faces serious.

19	19		301							1	Camu	You're in charge of patrolling, right? What are you doing here?	1

23	23		301							1	Soldier A	What's the point of patrolling? We're in a mobile base. We won't even be here anymore tomorrow.	2																					
24	24		301									Indeed, after the nightmare of an initiation test, Camu and the rest of the survivors have been dispatched to mobile fleets to perform missions outside the city. They have been doing so for two months.																						
25	25		301								Soldier B	Thought we'd be security guards in the city, but turned out we're mobile assault forces. Feels like we're in even more danger than soldiers, aren't we?	3																					
26	26		301								Camu	At least we've got ample supplies and excellent equipment. Besides, you're all excellent fighters, though not as good as me.	1																					
27	27		301								Soldier B	Camu, you lil...! Come on then, 1v1 me!	3																					
28	28		301								Camu	Oh? You want another loss on your records?	1																					
29	29		301									The squad members are prone to bantering, and no one would reprimand them for that—In fact, Camu's squad does not even have a leader.																						
30	30		301									Their missions are assigned via remote communications, and serums and other supplies are delivered via airdrop.																						
31	31		301								Camu	Anyway, that part aside, what were you guys talking about just now?	1																					
32	32		301								Soldier A	We were talking about the mission we had a few days ago. You should probably remember too... in that abandoned urban district.	2																					
33	33		301								Camu	You mean those nomads, huh?	1																					
34	34		301									"Nomads" are what they call vagrants who do not belong to a certain city, or exiled criminals.																						
35	35		301									A rather cruel way to deal with criminals, but most people seemed to have accepted it. This included civilians and the criminals themselves.																						
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As they talk, Camu remembers what happened that day.

43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Nomad Chief	That's a Kurono vehicle. Have it surrounded now! They definitely have serums and food!	1

48	48		301							1	Soldier A	What are they doing? Stay back! Stay back!	1																					
49	49		301									When passing through an area, Camu's squad found the road blocked by some large obstacles. They were about to hop off and clear the path when they realized that it was a trap set by nomads.																						
50	50		401							2	1510																							
51	51		301									Before the soldiers could react, the nomads opened fire, aiming at the weak points of the van. To protect their ride, the soldiers were forced into a defensive position.																						
52	52		301								Soldier A	Are you nuts? We're an official Kurono squad!	1

57	57		201							1	500197																							
58	58		301							1	Soldier B	What?	1																					
59	59		301									Though they were an official squad, most of the members were relatively inexperienced. Besides, these were humans and not the Corrupted, which complicated things.																						
60	60		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The moment of hesitation crippled the squad, and the nomads almost thought they could get away from this encounter alive.

69	68		301							1	Nomad	What...?	1																					
70	69		301									But Camu immediately shattered their hopes. Without anyone even noticing, he sneaked up next to the nomad chief and practically sliced him in half.

79	78		401							2	10001004																							
80	79		301									Following Camu's order, the squad members picked up their guns and fired at the nomads. Without their leader, the remaining nomads scattered and fled in horror, frightened by the gunfire and Camu himself.																						
81	80		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					There were some casualties, but at least they didn't lose any resources.

89	88		301								Camu	Are you sympathizing with them now? We've lost some of our men to them already.	1																					
90	89		301								Soldier A	I was just thinking that we might end up like them if we're not careful.	2																					
91	90		301								Soldier B	Some of them are around our age.	3																					
92	91		301								Camu	...They're unlucky, that's all.	1																					
93	92		301								Soldier A	What a world we live in.	2																					
94	93		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The soldier mutters, gives himself a serum shot and tosses another serum to Camu.
