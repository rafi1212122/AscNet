9	9		301									After the suspicious death, Camu and his squad continue performing their missions. One day, while the group is resting, the image of Mao Zhen suddenly appears on the big screen in front of them all.																						
10	10		301								Mao Zhen	I see you're as loud as always. And don't call me Master in front of other people.	1																					
11	11		301								Camu	Yes, Master!	2																					
12	12		301									Despite all that has happened before this, Camu is still excited to see his mentor.

15	15		301							1	Soldier	I have a question, Sir...	2																					
16	16		301								Mao Zhen	Fire away.	1																					
17	17		301								Soldier	Why do we have to burn down the city? We might not be able to reclaim it either way, but what good does burning it down do?	2																					
18	18		301								Mao Zhen	The place is pretty much a factory that produces endless streams of Corrupted.	1																					
19	19		301									Though most Corrupted act purely on instinct, like beasts, they do sometimes accidentally bring the virus to places such as factories.																						
20	20		301									Which will turn the factories into a Corrupted production line.																						
21	21		301									Mao Zhen's reply confirms that this is what has happened in this city. Though they can stop the process by destroying the production line, the density of the virus will still continue to increase in the city, as it usually does when the Corrupted gather.																						
22	22		301									Soon, not even filters will be able to save these areas.

25	25		301								Mao Zhen	Back to the point. We've summoned multiple mobile forces of your type for this mission and will be distributing the equipment needed for the burning via airdrop.	1																					
26	26		301								Mao Zhen	Destroy everythingâ€”Don't leave even a speck of dust behind. Headquarters' orders.	1																					
27	27		301								Mao Zhen	Got it?	1

30	30		301							1	Camu	Gotcha. By the way, what are you doing here, Master? And where have you been all these days?	2																					
31	31		301								Camu	And why are you looking like... that?	2																					
32	32		301									The soldiers start getting ready after the briefing, while Camu continues to bombard Mao Zhen with questions.																						
33	33		301								Mao Zhen	I'm not answering the first question as it is a company secret, but I CAN tell you about my appearanceâ€”I'm a Construct now.	1																					
34	34		301								Camu	Construct?	2																					
35	35		301								Mao Zhen	It's a bit hard to explain, but basically it's something more powerful than a human soldier and can defeat the Corrupted single-handedly.	1																					
36	36		301								Camu	Wow, sounds badass. Can I become a Construct too?	2																					
37	37		301								Mao Zhen	I can't tell you yet. Anyway, you should get ready. The mission starts in 3 hours.	1																					
38	38		301								Camu	Aw... Why so cold, Master? Anyway, Master, do you know anything about our squad? Back when I last went to townâ€”	2																					
39	39		301								Mao Zhen	It'll be fine, Camu. Just finish the mission. Everything will be fine.	1																					
40	40		301									Before Camu can question his mentor further, Mao Zhen cuts in.																						
41	41		301								Camu	What do you mean by thatâ€”	2																					
42	42		301								Mao Zhen	I meant that you'll perhaps overtake me in terms of skill after this mission. I read your messages. You were working hard towards a promotion, huh?	1																					
43	43		301								Camu	Oh? You mean we'll no longer need to travel out there after this mission?	2																					
44	44		301								Mao Zhen	If that's how you choose to interpret it. I'm busy, so I'll be disconnecting now.	1

55	55		301									After some preparations, Camu and co. arrive at the outskirts of the designated city. Countless Corrupted are peering at the Kurono troops through the wall openings while the military aircrafts circle around in the skiesâ€”

63	63		301								Pilot	According to orders, the burning will commence after you take out the Corrupted.	1																					
64	64		301								Camu	So you'll be bombing the place, basically?	2																					
65	65		301								Pilot	We're wasting fuel by hovering above the city, so please hurry and get rid of the Corrupted as soon as you can. We'll message you when it's time for retreat and then commence the bombing.	1

71	71		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Gritting his teeth and bearing the fresh pain from the injection, Camu leads the group toward the city.
