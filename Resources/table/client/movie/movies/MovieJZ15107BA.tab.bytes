3	3		301			DialogEnable					Camu	Uh...																						
4	4		301									Camu wakes up under blinding lights. He sees nothing but an expanse of white. He can sense the clutter and several people around him, though.																						
5	5		301								Camu	Are you...?																						
6	6		201							1	500058																							
7	7		301							1	Doctor	I suppose I count as a doctor. I will be operating on you to make you into a Construct.	1																					
8	8		301								Camu	Construct... So you're making me a Construct?																						
9	9		301								Doctor	Yes. You're not allowed to refuse, though.	1																					
10	10		301									Camu does not feel particularly aggressive anymore. He might have been tranquilized.																						
11	11		301									He does not even react to the word "Kurono", though he does feel a bit surprised about the Construct part.																						
12	12		301								Camu	Why are you doing this to me?																						
13	13		301								Doctor	Because everyone else besides you died from the virus. You're the only human who's survived so far with the Punishing Virus in you.	1																					
14	14		301									Not particularly enthused about being the exception, Camu tries to sit up, but soon realizes that his limbs have been tied down.																						
15	15		301									The person who calls himself a doctor is busy with some tools, probably preparing for an operation.																						
16	16		301								Camu	...Where's my Master?																						
17	17		301								Doctor	You mean Mao Zhen from Special Security? He died in the explosion. When we found him, his body was draped over you. Thanks to that, you weren't directly crushed.	1																					
18	18		301								Camu	What...?																						
19	19		301									Camu has no idea how to react. Before he can figure out why his mentor did that, a sharp pain jabs into his spine.																						
20	20		301								Camu	Ngh...																						
21	21		301								Doctor	Don't move.																						
22	22		301									An icy liquid pours into his body. The operation is about to begin.																						
23	23		301								Camu	Hey. Do whatever you want to me... Use me however you like... But promise me one thing.																						
24	24		301									The doctor falls silent for a bit before putting the syringe aside.																						
25	25		301								Doctor	Tell us. We'll see if we can work something out.	1																					
26	26		301								Camu	I don't know much about science, but if you guys at Kurono can make humans into Constructs, surely you can alter memories too. Even create fake personas...																						
27	27		301								Doctor	We can indeed manipulate memories, but a "persona" requires a certain amount of memory data from real life...	1																					
28	28		301								Camu	While you do your operation, can you replace my persona with a new one?																						
29	29		301								Camu	A persona that won't bother himself with anything complicating... A persona that can inspire courage in others...																						
30	30		301								Doctor	...	1																					
31	31		301								Doctor	What a coincidence... I wonder if it'll be a blessing or a curse. Camu... Kamui.	1																					
32	32		301								Doctor	We'll do it. Shall we name the persona "Kamui"?	1																					
33	33		202								1																							
34	34		301								Camu	Kamui... sounds a bit silly, but I don't have the right to decide, yeah?																						
35	35		301									Camu can tell that the doctor's crew are cutting his body open from the liquid pouring out, though he cannot feel anything due to the anesthesia.																						
36	36		301									His heart is beating faster, cold sweat glistening on his skin.																						
37	37		301									Even so, Camu ignores whatever is happening to him and starts thinking about "Kamui".																						
38	38		301								Camu	If I survive this, I'd like to see how you live through this world.																						
39	39		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	Teach me how to love this world... Kamui.
