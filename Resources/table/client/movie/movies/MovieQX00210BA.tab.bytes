5	5		301									Qu takes the gift and gracefully unwraps it as if she is fondling an antique.																						
6	6		301								Qu	...Seven-hole needles? Even I have not seen it in a long time. Some of those cultured hobbyists you mentioned were apparently attentive enough to do such thorough research on Kowloong customs.	1																					
7	7		302								Seven-hole needles? What are they for?	8																						
8	8		301									Looking at what Qu is holdingâ€”seven sewing needles in a row secured on a silk-covered pin cushionâ€”you cannot imagine what they are for.																						
9	9		301								Qu	I've only seen others try this during the festival when I was young, like this...	1																					
10	10		301									Qu picks up a thread from the cushion and tries to thread it through the eyes of the needles one by one. You hold your breath as you watch Qu making it through... two of the seven.																						
11	11		302								Did you turn off your balance and aiming modules?	12																						
12	12		301								Qu	Of course. What is the point otherwise? So, I made it through two needles... I haven't done much outside of my duty since I understood that the will of Kowloong and mine is one and the same.	1
