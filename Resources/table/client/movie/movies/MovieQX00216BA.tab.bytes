5	5		301									Haicma is holding a flipbook in her hands. Flipping through it will reveal an animated sequence formed by connecting the images on the subsequent pages.																						
6	6		301									This small book tells the story of how the weaver girl and the cowherd from the myths met on the magpie bridge on Double Seventh Festival.

8	8		301								Haicma	I have browsed data surrounding the stories of Alpha Lyrae and Alpha Aquila in the past, but I can't say I completely understand it.	1

11	11		301				DialogDisable				Haicma	In theory, there is no way for Lyrae and Aquila to meet periodically. Why would the myths speak of something impossible?	1																					
12	12		302								Perhaps it was to give people something to look forward to?	13																						
13	13		302								Perhaps it was to muster the strength to beat the impossible.	14																						
14	14		302								The meaning of a myth depends on how you interpret it.	15

16	16		301									Haicma's fingers stop the flipbook on the page when the weaver girl and the cowherd step on the bridge. She only closes it after staring at it for a while.

18	18		301								Haicma	I shall take time to ponder itâ€”no. In fact, I'm going to make some notes now. Would you mind going over them after I'm done?	1
