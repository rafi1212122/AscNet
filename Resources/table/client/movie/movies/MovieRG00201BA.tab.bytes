10	10		301							1	Hassen	As you all know, Babylonia has been engaged in tactical warfare with forces on the surface...	3																					
11	11		301							1	Hassen	And the effort to reclaim deserted urban areas in good conditions is well underway...	3																					
12	12		301							1	Hassen	So, the next step is to send all of you to areas near where those forces are based.	3
