3	4		301							1	Devil 7	Welcome aboard!																						
4	5		302								Isn't this...	556																						
5	556		201							2	1011001	0																						
6	6		301							1	Lee	Despite the resemblance, this ship is not in very good condition.	2																					
7	7		301							1	Devil 7	Oh, they say this ship is the sister ship of that Kua-Er grade ship.																						
8	666		202							2																								
9	8		301							1	Devil 7	But the configuration of its propulsion system was never finished because of the virus.																						
10	9		302								So that's why they look so alike?	10																						
11	10		301							1	Devil 7	Probably. Anyway, it's impossible to sail it out of here now.																						
12	11		301							1	Devil 7	Even if we manage to get it onto the water...																						
13	12		301							1	Devil 7	How long can we expect a ship without power, displacement, or even sea valves to stay afloat?																						
14	13		301							1	Devil 7	Simply put, until we find the lair of the Corrupted attacking us, the fishermen will not be safe.																						
15	14		301							1	Devil 7	Even though my boss says Abyssea is capable of handling its own affairs...																						
16	15		301							1	Devil 7	But that's just him playing tough. He's probably thinking about hiring people he normally can't afford...																						
17	16		301							1	Devil 7	Or even selling us to the Ascendants, like Akdilek did.																						
18	17		302								...	18																						
19	18		301							1	Lee	But how come you still contacted Babylonia?	2																					
20	19		301							1	Devil 7	Well, one day when I was selling fish, I heard from a merchant that Babylonia offered help to Akdilek.																						
21	20		301							1	Devil 7	So I thought, "What if they're willing to help us too?"																						
22	21		302								All roads lead to Rome...	22	...You've come to the right people.	22																				
23	22		301							1	Devil 7	Exactly!																						
24	23		301							1	Devil 7	If you can complete this mission, then I'll be able to convince the Abyssea Shipyard to accept help from Babylonia.																						
25	24		301							1	Devil 7	Anyway, this is all that Celica lady's idea, huh?																						
26	25		301							1	Devil 7	I'm not sure why would she be so kind as to help us, but I, Devil 7, will not let her down!																						
27	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Devil 7	Okay then, let's start by searching the abandoned ships here!
