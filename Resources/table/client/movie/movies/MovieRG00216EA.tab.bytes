33	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Mayor's Message	Thanks to your help, Wuming City is finally ready to expand its residential area and rebuild its industrial zone.																						
34	36		301								Mayor's Message	It's okay. Wuming City started out as a fishing village with just 336 residents. No matter what happens, we'll get through it.																						
35	37		301								Misty Enclave Refugee	Thank you so much for making Wuming City safe again.																						
36	38		301								Misty Enclave Refugee	Wuming City will be connected to the "Virtual Mart" soon. If you're in need of any goods, 【kuroname】, we'll be glad to seek them out for you!

41	43		301								Sagawa's Message	The old man specifically asked that I save the best portion for you guys. Come eat!																						
42	44		301								Letter Delivered by Devil 7	Ha! It's me, Devil 7! Since our ground-air communication devices are still on their way, I had to ask an Akdilek merchant who came to buy fish to deliver this message for me.																						
43	45		301								Letter Delivered by Devil 7	"All is well in Abyssea! Devil 6, Devil 10 and Devil 11 keep asking when you'll be back to play with them! Especially Devil 6, he won't stop going on about wanting to learn cooking from Miss Liv!"
