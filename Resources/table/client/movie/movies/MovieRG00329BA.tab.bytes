6	6		301							1	Demon King	I thought I could at least get one artifact fragment back and gain some power, but we bumped into the two heroes working for the King.	1																					
7	7		301								Demon King	In the end, Liv tried to protect me and was taken by them. Fortunately, I met you.	1

10	10		301							1	Lucia	Collecting the Goddess' artifact and Liv to control this world... Is that King really trying to destroy everything?	2																					
11	11		301								Demon King	I was also under the influence of a bug and learned the truth of this world, so I think I can understand him.	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	I guess that's why he was doing things that benefited nobody... But right now, our priority is to rescue Liv.	2

16	16		201							1	500113																							
17	17		301							1	Demon King	She must be in the Demon King's Castle. Once the King has the artifact and the Holy Maiden, he will be there.	1																					
18	18		302								Isn't the Demon King's Castle hidden?	19	What is he doing there?	20																				
19	19	21	301								Demon King	It is, but it can't move. Anyone can find out its location if they want to. On top of that, to use the Goddess' artifact, one must activate the altar inside the castle.	1																					
20	20	21	301								Demon King	There is an altar of the Goddess inside the Demon King's Castle. Only the altar can unlock the real power of the artifact.	1

25	25		301							1	Kamui	Um... Why?	2																					
26	26		301								Karenina	Use your brain! To make the Demon King's Castle appear, or to make his wishes come true, the King will need to use the Goddess' artifact.	1																					
27	27		301								Karenina	What if we get there and fall into Vera and the King's traps...	1																					
28	28		301								Kamui	I guess we have no other option. It's easy to run away though, just close the game.	2																					
29	29		301								Karenina	What...	1																					
30	30		301								Kamui	But I don't think anyone is going to do it. We choose to keep playing not because we are obsessed with it, nor for the rewards. We play on, simply because we started the game.	2																					
31	31		301								Kamui	Because we are the heroes of this game. This was a famous quote I heard long ago, too bad I forgot the exact work.	2																					
32	32		302								I also think we should go.	33	As heroes, we mustn't run away.	34																				
33	33	35	301								Kamui	Alright, let's go!	2																					
34	34	35	301								Kamui	I love that line too, Commandant!	2
