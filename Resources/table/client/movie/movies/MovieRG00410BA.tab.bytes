3	3		301									The Border Commune...																						
4	4		301									An autonomous organization formed by refugees who fled when a segment of the Arctic defense line collapsed.																						
5	5		301									The ARU could not bear to let them cross the vast permafrost wasteland and find their own way. So, when they came near New Murmansk, the ARU took them in.																						
6	6		301									They settled there once Babylonia regained Port Kyaranta.																						
7	7		302								So they have the Moses class icebreakers?	8

10	10		301							1	Staessen	Yes, but...	2																					
11	11		301								Lee	But?	1																					
12	12		301								Staessen	But due to certain reasons, it might be a bit difficult to get them to hand over the two icebreakers now.	2																					
13	13		301								Lee	What do you mean by that?	1																					
14	14		301								Staessen	We tried skirting around the topic a little, but they were firm in their attitude.	2																					
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Staessen	Let me go with you. They should be more willing to speak with the leader of the ARU.	2

23	23		301							1	Staessen	...Okay, then.	2																					
24	24		301								Staessen	First things first—the Arctic Route Union is a complex organization.	2

26	26		301							1	Liv	We've read the files.	1																					
27	27		301								Staessen	When was your intel last updated?	2																					
28	28		201							1	500026		-400																					
29	29		301							1	Lee	That's classified.	1																					
30	30		301								Staessen	...Forget it. Does your intel mention the Green-Vanostok Line?	2																					
31	31		301								Lee	That's something under the Arctic branch of the World Government's facility, if I'm not mistaken. What does it have to do with the Arctic Route Union?	1																					
32	32		301								Staessen	...Looks like you don't know.	2																					
33	33		301								Staessen	Just think for a moment. Where do you think the refugees went once the Corrupted destroyed the Green-Vanostock Line from the inside out?	2																					
34	34		201							1	1031001	14	-400																					
35	35		301							1	Liv	After the World Government escorted them to New Yansk, their signal went offline...	1																					
36	36		201							1	500026		-400																					
37	37		301							1	Lee	That's preposterous. How could they have gone from New Yansk to New Murmansk...?	1																					
38	38		301								Staessen	I know, I know... That's nearly 6,000 kilometers. The tundra on the Siberian Plain has melted considerably, but it's still not an easy road to travel on...	2																					
39	39		301								Staessen	So once they reached the ARU's settlement... There were only 1,000 survivors.	2																					
40	40		201							1	1031001	7	-400																					
41	41		301							1	Liv	1,000...? But there were 64,000 refugees that left New Yansk...	1																					
42	42		301								Staessen	There were that many, huh...? I'm sorry to hear that.	2
