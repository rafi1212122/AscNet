4	4		301							1		Everyone has left except Ayla.																						
5	5		301								Ayla	...	1																					
6	6		301									Staring at the blank sky, Ayla suddenly begins to speak.																						
7	7		301								Ayla	I know you are more than just a narrator.	1																					
8	8		301								Narration	...I'm listening.																						
9	9		301								Ayla	As we progressed through the movies, you began to sound more like a human. You even started to control yourself, trying not to relate with us emotionally.	1																					
10	10		301								Ayla	Did you want to say something when Liv said the scenes of "The Evil Demon" looked like her old home?	1																					
11	11		301								Narration	...Well, that little girl had a tough life, just like I did.																						
12	12		301								Ayla	Your childhood was very similar to Liv's, that's why you ran away from home. The funding from WGAAâ€”which was called the United Nations Art Foundation back thenâ€”helped you become a director.	1																					
13	13		301								Ayla	You are no narrator. You are George D. Toro himself.	1																					
14	14		301								Narration	George D. Toro died while shooting "Final Escape 2". How can I be George D. Toro?																						
15	15		301								Ayla	Because the Science Council's Memory Chip technology "just" started clinical trials at that time.	1																					
16	16		301								Ayla	There was no access record of the hidden section, but after Camp Inferno got discontinued, I found a writing record with unknown signature.	1																					
17	17		301								Ayla	That was when you transferred your memory into this disc. Am I right?	1																					
18	18		301								Narration	A very good guess, but why would I do that?																						
19	19		301								Ayla	You were bitter that Camp Inferno ended just like that.	1																					
20	20		301								Ayla	You want to see the first student to pass all the tests with your own eyes. You want to witness someone who can inherit your legacy.	1																					
21	21		301								Narration	...But I have no legacy for you to inherit now.																						
22	22		301								Narration	When you found this disc and plugged it to your console, I managed to connect to your network.																						
23	23		301								Narration	I learned about what happened next.																						
24	24		301								Narration	The Golden Age had ended. Humans retreated into corners, barely surviving. The "glorious and prosperous human society" no longer existed, right? Entertainment isn't needed in a post-apocalyptic world, and movies are no exception.																						
25	25		301								Ayla	But I still want to keep them in this world.	1																					
26	26		301								Ayla	Because the human society would be worthless without the spiritual treasure.	1																					
27	27		301								Ayla	You have been waiting for someone to see through your traps and disguise. Why else would you imprison yourself in this container?	1																					
28	28		301								Ayla	Artists are always greedy. Their dream has no limit, and they will keep searching until they die.	1																					
29	29		301								Ayla	My duty is to preserve the works of people like you, so artists in future can appreciate them.	1																					
30	30		301								Narration	You are the winner, it's completely up to you. I'm only a memory, right?																						
31	31		301								Narration	I have passed the baton to the next generation like you.																						
32	32		301								Ayla	You wish.	1																					
33	33		301									Ayla speaks with great confidence.																						
34	34		301								Ayla	As a director, you didn't put any of your movies in the test. All we saw were other directors' works that you liked. I can only think that you weren't satisfied with your own works.	1																					
35	35		204							1																								
36	36		301								Ayla	One day, the weirdos in the Science Council would be able to get you out from here. I'll make sure you enjoy the latest memory technologies of Babylonia.	1																					
37	37		301								Ayla	When you hold a video camera with your own hands again, I doubt you will ever say things like "I have passed the baton to you" again.	1																					
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39		301									With that, Ayla logs out.																						
40	40		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Narration	...I'll look forward to it.
