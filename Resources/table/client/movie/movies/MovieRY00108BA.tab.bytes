13	13		301							1	Ayla	According to my calculations run on Commandant's connection status, this mansion is the center of all signals.	1

30	30		301								Bianca	I'm too used to this kind of situation. So, where is the Gray Raven Commandant?	1

52	52		302								You're the one who kidnapped me?	53	Vera!	54																				
53	53	55	301								Vera	Well, like I said, revealing the truth like this is so anticlimactic.	1																					
54	54		301								Vera	I thought you had forgotten my name, Commandant of Gray Raven.	1																					
55	55		301								Vera	Anyway, here's a formal introduction. I am Vera, captain of Babylonia Task Force "Cerberus".	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Smiling, the red-haired female Construct gives a slow and elegant bow, as if she is giving a thank-you speech.																						
58	58		201							1	500002																							
59	59		301							1	Vera	I know you want to ask what I've done to them. It's actually very simple; I just took control of their bodies using the connection chamber.	1																					
60	60		301								Vera	You've experienced it yourself, so I don't need to explain further. A commandant can make Constructs do—almost—anything using the chamber.	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	Whether they like it or not. That's a free lesson for you on the applications of the connection chamber.	1																					
62	62		302								What do you want?	63	This isn't how a game works.	64																				
63	63	65	301								Vera	Just an April Fool's prank, nothing more—or not.	1																					
64	64		301								Vera	Relax, I'm not going to play dirty to win.	1																					
65	65		301								Vera	Time to kick off the next stage of the game. Remember? You need to get your Constructs to rescue you before the time runs out.	1																					
66	66		301								Vera	And you've done a great job. So now, it's your turn to save them.	1																					
67	67		201							1	500110																							
68	68		301							1	Ayla	...!	1																					
69	69		201							1	500002																							
70	70		301							1	Vera	The rules are simple. Your mind will be connected to the Nozzle unit. You need to match them to who they really are.	1																					
71	71		302								The cognitive discrepancies...	72	What's the meaning of this?	73																				
72	72	74	301								Vera	I did that specifically for this stage.	1																					
73	73		301								Vera	Have you forgotten that you are still having cognitive discrepancies? What you see may not be real. Are you certain that this Liv, and others you see, are the real ones?	1																					
74	74		301								Vera	I'm not that cruel, so I'll let you know who's here.	1																					
75	75		301								Vera	Lucia, Lee, Liv, Bianca, Karenina, Kamui, Chrome, and Ayla. Whoever you see, these are the ones standing right here.	1
