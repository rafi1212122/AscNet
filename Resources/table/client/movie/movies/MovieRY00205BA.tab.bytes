13	13		301									Lowering her head, Nanami looks absolutely miserable. Karenina sighs, no longer able to keep a sullen face, and stops being angry.																						
14	14		301								Karenina	It's fine. I wasn't mad in the first place because, you know...	1																					
15	15		301								Karenina	You know, today is April Fool's Day. I'm not going to get pissed off by that little prank of yours.	1																					
16	16		204							2	1																							
17	17		301								Nanami	Oh, Karey deary is the best!	2																					
18	18		301								Karenina	Alright, alright, stop interrupting my work already. I still have to finish the routine maintenance work on Gestalt's power supply...	1																					
19	19		301									Nanami suddenly remembers that the main reason she is here is to warn Karenina of the anomaly inside Gestalt.																						
20	20		204							2	5																							
21	21		301								Nanami	Aah! Mecha babushka... I mean, Gestalt! Gestalt is in danger!	2																					
22	22		301								Karenina	What?	1																					
23	23		301								Nanami	Nanami discovered a major bug in Gestalt! If we ignore it, the whole Babylonia could be crippled!	2																					
24	24		301								Karenina	What are you talking about... Gestalt has the highest-level defense system for physical and logical dangers. There's no way a bug appears without triggering the alarm.	1																					
25	25		301									Karenina is still quite doubtful, but Nanami's intense earnestness gives her story a little more credibility.

29	29		301							1	Lee	Don't listen to her...	3																					
30	30		301									Lee walks in from outside, passing Karenina the files in his hand.																						
31	31		301								Lee	This is the report of the checkup your Engineering Force requested Asimov's team to do on the logic nodes of Gestalt. They had to have me bring it to you on my way back to the lounge.	3																					
32	32		301								Karenina	There are no bugs or errors found inside Gestalt on the report. The routine maintenance has been carried out with no deviation as well...	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	So, what tricks are you pulling this time, Nanami?	3																					
34	34		204							2																								
35	35		301								Nanami	This isn't a trick... Nanami really did see a large anomaly dimension in there!	2																					
36	36		301								Lee	Come on, at least add some technical specificity to your lies the second time...	3																					
37	37		301								Lee	Ignoring the fact that usual Constructs can't just connect to Gestalt without its permissionâ€”if there is indeed a critical bug like that, it would have been discovered already. Not to mention...	3																					
38	38		301								Lee	You have used the same lie to trick me this morning... exactly the same.	3																					
39	39		301								Nanami	Eh... d-did I? Nanami doesn't seem to remember...	2																					
40	40		301									Trying to play innocence, Nanami can feel the intense heat from the immense fury burning by her side.																						
41	41		204							1	5																							
42	42		301								Karenina	Is... that... so...	1																					
43	43		301								Karenina	I knew you wouldn't have apologized to me willingly! You're just trying to trick me again!	1																					
44	44		301								Nanami	I'm really not!	2																					
45	45		301								Karenina	****! Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me twice?! Get out of here!	1																					
46	46		204							2	14																							
47	47		301								Nanami	Please listen... Nanami's telling the truth...	2

52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Nanami	Why... why does no one believe me? Nanami was telling the truth this time...	1																					
53	53		301									After getting kicked out, Nanami has gone looking for a few other Constructs, but none have chosen to believe her. At her wit's end, she is once again back in the Gray Raven lounge.																						
54	54		301									â€”She has no basis for this assumption, but her instinct tells her that only one human will believe her.																						
55	55		301								Nanami	Has Nanami really lied that much? Is no one ever going to believe Nanami again?	1																					
56	56		301								Nanami	Does that mean... Nanami is alone again?	1																					
57	57		301									In the past, Nanami would wander the wilds by herself, talk to herself, solve problems with the data she had by herself, head for an imaginary destination by herself... and she has always been fine.																						
58	58		301								Nanami	Nanami never needed anyone but herself... except this doesn't feel quite right...	1																					
59	59		301								Nanami	...Why oh why would Nanami want friends?	1																					
60	60		202							1					1																			
61	61		301									Lying on the recliner, Nanami curls up and starts to fall asleep... At that moment, the door to the lounge opens, and in come two people chatting.																						
62	62		201							1	500155																							
63	63		301							1	Chrome	Indeed. From our previous experience, the tactics we use when confronted by a large group of enemies still need optimization...	1																					
64	64		302								We can go over it again at the lounge's sandbox.	65																						
65	65		301								Chrome	Commandant, someone seems to be inside already?	1																					
66	66		302								Nanami? Why are you here...	67																						
67	67		203							1	0.25	-400																						
68	68		201							2	500091		400																					
69	69		301							1	Nanami	Commandant, Captain Chrome... You're back from your meeting!	2																					
70	70		301								Chrome	Have you been waiting for us, Nanami? What's wrong?	1																					
71	71		302								I'm sorry, but we don't have time to play with you today.	72																						
72	72		301								Nanami	I'm not here to play! Nanami has an important task that needs your help! Look...	2																					
73	73		301									Nanami remembers that no one has believed her so far due to her lies, and she doubts the two of you will believe her either.																						
74	74		301								Nanami	Sigh... Forget it... You won't believe me anyway...	2																					
75	75		301								Chrome	That assessment is up to us. Whether to tell your truth, on the other hand, is up to you.	1																					
76	76		302								Tell us what's going on first, either way.	77																						
77	77		301								Nanami	Are you sure? Although it's quite unbelievable, Nanami saw it with her own eyes!	2																					
78	78		301									Seeing that the two of you are keen to listen, Nanami decides not to hold back.																						
79	79		204							2	5																							
80	80		301								Nanami	I've discovered an expanding anomaly inside Gestalt, with these weird programs who attacked Nanami! If we don't take care of it, I think it will cripple Gestalt!	2																					
81	81		301								Nanami	But no one is willing to believe Nanami...	2																					
82	82		301									Chrome, who has been listening quietly, nods and offers his analysis.																						
83	83		301								Chrome	If the anomaly happens inside of Gestalt... it will be a much trickier complication than an invasion from outside.	1																					
84	84		301									Just like how a human body is much more equipped to handle viral infections instead of cancerous mutation of their cells.																						
85	85		301								Chrome	Kamui and Wanshi are both out on a mission. I doubt I can contact them. How about the Gray Ravens, Commandant?	1																					
86	86		302								(Shake your head)	87																						
87	87		301								Chrome	In that case, the two of us are all we can deploy right now. That being the case, I still think that we should investigate this incident. But it might be quite dangerous, Commandant...	1																					
88	88		302								Don't worry about me. Let's go.	89																						
89	89		204							1	1																							
90	90		301									Chrome smiles, seemingly expecting your answer.																						
91	91		301								Chrome	As you wish. Nanami, what do you need us to do?	1																					
92	92		204							1	14																							
93	93		301								Nanami	Does that mean you believe Nanami?!	2																					
94	94		301								Chrome	I don't know how you entered Gestalt, and Kamui did warn me about your pranks on April Fool's Day after he was tricked by you earlier today...	1																					
95	95		301								Chrome	But the anomaly you spoke of could be devastating. It's better to be safe than sorry.	1																					
96	96		302								Agreed.	97	I'd rather it be one of your pranks.	97																				
97	97		204							2	1																							
98	98		301								Nanami	That's wonderful news! Then you should both follow Nanami now!	2																					
99	99		301									Chrome and you look at each other, uncertain what Nanami actually means.																						
100	100		204							2	8																							
101	101		301								Nanami	Oh... I forgot that not everyone can just connect to Gestalt directly...	2																					
102	102		302								Huh? What was that?	103																						
103	103		301								Nanami	Don't worry! Nanami has a plan!	2																					
104	104		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				What?	105

107	107		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Nanami drags the both of you out of the lounge.																						
108	108		302								Hold on, hold on! Where are we going?	109																						
109	109		201							1	500091																							
110	110		301							1	Nanami	To an "immersion frame," any one of them!	1																					
111	111		301									You arrive before a device that looks like a metal sleeping pod, and Nanami forcefully put both Chrome and you into the device.																						
112	112		301								Nanami	The backdoor from last time should still be open... You can connect to Gestalt if Nanami uses her mind to guide you and create the virtual space!	1																					
113	113		302								How would that work...	114																						
114	114		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					As the door to the pod closes, darkness immediately floods your mind, and you go unconscious.
