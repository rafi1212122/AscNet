4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Karenina	What? Did you guys forget breakfast?	1																					
5	5		301								Karenina	Start listening to me and swing your weapon like this, not that!	1																					
6	6		201							1	500019																							
7	7		301							1	Construct	Like this?	1																					
8	8		201							1	1111001	5																						
9	9		301							1	Karenina	That!	1																					
10	10		301									In an earthbound base of Babylonia, Karenina is training new recruits as a military instructor.																						
11	11		201							1	500019																							
12	12		301							1	Construct	...Like that?	1																					
13	13		201							1	1111001	5																						
14	14		301							1	Karenina	What a bunch of idiots!	1																					
15	15		202							1					1																			
16	16		301									Although her expertise on the battlefield should prove her an adequate instructor, Karenina's lack of experience in teaching has given the recruits and her a hard time communicating.																						
17	17		201							1	1091001																							
18	18		301							1	Bianca	What Karenina was saying is that you should make use of your mechanical parts. For example, the way you sheath your blade would be much more efficient if you utilize your wrist joint and rotate it here.	1																					
19	19		201							1	500019																							
20	20		301							1	Construct	Like this!	1																					
21	21		201							1	1111001																							
22	22		301							1	Karenina	Ah...	1																					
23	23		201							1	1091001																							
24	24		301							1	Bianca	Exactly. You might not be used to it at first, but it'll become more familiar after a few fights in the battle simulations.	1																					
25	25		301								Bianca	You can also apply this thinking to other areas. Taking advantage of your Construct self will be your most important lesson henceforth.	1																					
26	26		203							1	0.25	-400																						
27	27		201							2	500019		400																					
28	28		301							1	Construct	Understood!	2																					
29	29		301								Bianca	Continue your training, then. I've something that requires Karenina's attention.	1																					
30	30		201							2	1111001		400																					
31	31		301							1	Karenina	...Bianca.	2																					
32	32		301								Bianca	I know I said I'd let you do it your way, but I've got a feeling that they won't learn more than one move today the way it was going, so I had to intervene.	1																					
33	33		301								Bianca	I'm sorry.	1																					
34	34		301								Karenina	...	2																					
35	35		301									She would have kept complaining, but Karenina is powerless against Bianca's apology. Begrudgingly she kicks the floor.																						
36	36		301								Karenina	I thought it'd be a fun mission, but turns out I'm just training a bunch of noobs in the middle of nowhere. Sucks to be me.	2																					
37	37		301									She raises her head.																						
38	38		301								Karenina	You said you were looking for me?	2																					
39	39		301								Bianca	That's right. I need your help making a communication device that can connect to a specific satellite.	1																					
40	40		301								Karenina	Don't we have a bunch of those in the base? Just use one of 'em for calls if it's for a mission.	2																					
41	41		301								Bianca	Comms are always fully occupied in a recruit training facility like this. And it's not a mission-related call either, so I shouldn't be using the base's equipment.	1																					
42	42		301								Karenina	What call is it, then?	2																					
43	43		301								Bianca	This one.	1																					
44	44		301									After making sure she has her attention, Bianca passes Karenina her portable terminal, showing her a mail that has been forwarded a couple of times.																						
45	45		301								Karenina	This? What are they, children?	2																					
46	46		301								Bianca	But didn't you help last time?	1																					
47	47		301								Karenina	T-that... that was...	2																					
48	48		301								Bianca	Can you help me, Karenina? Let's just have some fun.	1																					
49	49		301								Karenina	...	2																					
50	50		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	Fine! I'll do it.	2
