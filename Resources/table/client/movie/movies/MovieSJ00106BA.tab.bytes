6	6		301								???	"Hi, ma'am. What are you doing?"																						
7	7		301								???	"I'm spinning thread. Take a look. What do you think? Would a cute little girl such as yourself like to try?"

13	13		301								Female Researcher	...However, these subjects are in very poor health and have serious traumatic stress disorder.	2																					
14	14		301								Male Researcher	Humanoid-hybrid Constructs are different from normal Constructs. The former is more effective in combat, but this seriously impacts the stability of their consciousness.	1																					
15	15		301								Male Researcher	If the subject is modified while their consciousness is unstable, I'm afraid...	1

27	27		301							1	Female Researcher	You're awake.	1																					
28	28		301									A woman wearing a mask and a lab coat appeared before me. She gently put her hand on my forehead, and I could smell the soft aroma of her disinfectant.																						
29	29		301								Amberia	...																						
30	30		301									Unable to speak, I could only reach out and grab the women's clothes.																						
31	31		301								Female Researcher	This is the ARUs scientific research institution, "Niflheim". It now also functions as a care facility.	1																					
32	32		301								Female Researcher	I'm... the doctor responsible for taking care of you.	1																					
33	33		301								Female Researcher	Captain Pfaff rescued you. Don't you remember? Don't worry, you and your comrades are safe.	1																					
34	34		301								Female Researcher	Everything is okay now. Get well soon.	1																					
35	35		301								Amberia	...Where's my daddy?																						
36	36		301									I must have sounded hoarse and frightened... The white-clad woman's eyes showed a look of pity.																						
37	37		301								Female Researcher	The armed forces have gone to search for survivors, but unfortunately, your father has not been found yet.	1																					
38	38		301								Female Researcher	You're in rough shape. You'll need to take it easy for now.	1

41	41		301									Since then, I have been locked up in this "ward".																						
42	42		301									Painful groans and sad wails could be heard throughout the care facility each day, as if they were being tortured.																						
43	43		301									When I asked about the screams to the female doctor who came to check on me, she only says that the refugees who sustained burns are changing their dressings.																						
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Does it really... hurt that bad?

47	48		201							1	500058																							
48	49		301							1	Male Researcher	Correct. If you become a "Construct", you can get rid of your sick body, and you'll never ever get sick again. Also, you'll be a hundred times stronger than a regular person.	1																					
49	50		301								Male Researcher	Once you complete all your missions assigned by the ARU, you can go anywhere you want.	1																					
50	51		301								Male Researcher	And, of course, you can also go look for your father. After all... We haven't found his body yet. It's always good to have some hope.	1																					
51	52		301								Male Researcher	...One more thing.	1																					
52	53		301								Male Researcher	If you agree to become a Construct, I guarantee that the people of Soltvara will receive the best treatment. When the Punishing Virus is vanquished, the ARU will find a suitable place for them to live.	1																					
53	54		301								Male Researcher	They'll have somewhere to start a new life, rather than be homeless.	1																					
54	55		301								Male Researcher	Isn't this what your father would have wanted?	1																					
55	56		301									...Is this my "atonement?"																						
56	57		301								Amberia	...																						
57	58		301								Male Researcher	So? What is your decision?	1																					
58	59		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Amberia	I agree... to becoming a Construct.
