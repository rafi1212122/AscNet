8	8		302								It's an endless desert.	9	Let's confirm our assignment once again.	11																				
9	9		201							1	1031001																							
10	10	13	301							1	Liv	We've gone through one sandstorm after another, and I thought we would see something different after we're through... But it's just more desert	1																					
11	11		201							1	1011001																							
12	12		301							1	Lee	Right, we were sent here in such a rush, after all.	1																					
13	13		201							1	1021001																							
14	14		301							1	Lucia	Alright, let me re-establish our mission parameters before we begin.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	Our mission this time is to investigate the mysterious zone at the center of the sandstorm, the area nicknamed "Golden Vortex". According to our mission brief, we aren't the only team sent here from Babylonia.	1																					
16	16		301								Lucia	Among the other teams are Goldfinch, the infiltration and intel collection experts, as well as the Purifying Force, and a Jointed Task Force that has gathered different personnel available in short notice.	1																					
17	17		302								What's so special about this place?	18																						
18	18		201							1	1011001																							
19	19		301							1	Lee	It's the sand. The sand here looks identical to gold dust.	1

21	21		201							2	1021001		-400																					
22	22		301							1	Lucia	Our mission can't be related to the sand. Babylonia wouldn't have sent us here for strange sand.	2																					
23	23		301								Lee	This sand is everywhere. Something is moving them in secret... And to be able to cover such a large area, it must be a very huge device.	1																					
24	24		201							1	1031001		400																					
25	25		301								Lucia	Liv, are we able to contact the Goldfinches? They would probably have better intel.	2																					
26	26		301								Liv	(Shakes her head) We can't. I've tried multiple times, but nothing's come through. Maybe their comms equipment has malfunctioned? I'll keep trying...	1																					
27	27		201							2	1011001		-400																					
28	28		301							1	Lee	Goldfinch doesn't have a lot of combat gears on them, but they should be equipped with state-of-the-art comms devices...	2																					
29	29		301								Lee	I need to re-evaluate how dangerous this place is.	2

32	32		301								Liv	Commandant, something's approaching us at 12 o'clock.	1

41	41		301							1	Lucia	Liv, protect the commandant. Lee, open fire if he so much as raises his arm.	1																					
42	42		301								Lee	...Multiple severe wounds detected on his body.	2																					
43	43		201							2	500028		400																					
44	100		401							2	1515																							
45	44		301								Browning	...AaAaArm... CaAaAn't... My apologiesâ€”something's wrong with my speaking module. I can't raise my arm even if I want to.	2																					
46	45		301								Browning	My name is Browning, the captain of Goldfinch. My... M.I.N.D. ID canâ€”c-confirmâ€”m-my identity.	2																					
47	46		204							1	3																							
48	47		301								Lucia	What happened? Where's your team?	1																					
49	48		204							1																								
50	49		301								Browning	T-trapped. It's all myâ€”f-faultâ€”my fault...	2																					
51	50		301								Lucia	Calm down and tell us what happened.	1																					
52	51		301								Browning	They... c-came out of nowhere... Ambushedâ€”i-it was a trapâ€”my team... held them off toâ€”s-save me...	2																					
53	52		204							1	3																							
54	53		301								Lucia	"They"? The Corrupted?	1																					
55	54		204							1																								
56	55		301								Browning	N-no... M-mechanoidsâ€”m-mechanoids.	2																					
57	56		301								Browning	P-please... save the Goldfinchesâ€”I-I can't... I'm no match to them.	2																					
58	57		301								Lucia	You need to hold on for your team!	1																					
59	58		301								Browning	I-I'm so... useless... I-I've failedâ€”t-the Goldfinches...	2

62	61		201							2	1031001		400																					
63	62		301							1	Lee	Commandant, come over here...	1																					
64	63		301								Liv	Browning's condition is really bad... He doesn't seem to be able to forgive himself...	2																					
65	64		301								Lee	Both the M.I.N.D. ID and frame model matchesâ€”he is Browning, no doubt. However...	1																					
66	65		301								Lee	My instinct's telling me something's wrong with him. But I have nothing concrete right now.	1																					
67	66		301								Liv	I also feel the same. But after what he's been through... Doesn't it make sense that something's off with him?	2																					
68	67		201							2	1021001		400																					
69	68		301							1	Lucia	I'm very concerned with the mechanoids he mentioned. How are they different from the Corrupted?	2																					
70	69		301								Lee	If we're going to rescue Goldfinch, we're definitely going to run into these mechanoids.	1																					
71	70		301								Lucia	Commandant, rescuing the Goldfinches won't interrupt our original mission. We can even make use of the intel they have.	2																					
72	71		302								Then let's begin.	72	What sort of mechanoids attacked your team?	75																				
73	72		202							1	2				1

75	74	78	301							1	Lucia	Roger, Commandant. Everyone, stay alert...	1

78	77	79	301							1	Browning	So many... of themâ€”a-all kinds of modelsâ€”a-all kinds of weapons...	1																					
79	78		201							1	500028																							
80	79		301							1	Browning	(Watches the sand in the air) Golden Vortex... is actually a building... The closer we are to the buildingâ€”t-the more mechanoids there are... We can't just walkâ€”w-walk there...	1																					
81	80		203							1	0.25	400																						
82	81		201							2	1011001		-400																					
83	82		301							1	Lee	Is it possible to take the route Goldfinch took to approach the center of the Golden Vortex?	2																					
84	83		301								Browning	We used... u-usedâ€”motion distractors... to lure them awayâ€”b-before approaching the building.	1																					
85	84		301								Browning	L-lost it when... I escapedâ€”b-but... I remember where it is.	1																					
86	85		301								Lee	I'll go look for it with you.	2																					
87	86		301								Browning	N-no... The distractor requires two operators... T-the window of opportunity is very short, we must work simultaneously... Two outsideâ€”t-two inside... Your frame doesn't match... H-hers does.	1																					
88	87		201							2	1031001	7	-400																					
89	88		301							1	Liv	Do you mean me, Browning?	2																					
90	89		204							2																								
91	90		301								Browning	You're a Support-type Constructâ€”r-right? So am I... You and Iâ€”w-we're in charge of luring from the outside. When the other two Gray Ravens enter the interiorâ€”p-pass them the operation command, and then we go in.	1																					
92	91		301								Liv	Then I'll go. Operating devices is my expertise as well.	2																					
93	92		201							1	1011001		400																					
94	93		301							1	Lee	I can't believe that Browning's also one of those who can come up with a plan of operation at a moment's notice.	1																					
95	94		201							1	1021001		400																					
96	95		301							1	Lucia	Lee...	1																					
97	102		204							1	3																							
98	96		301								Lucia	Are you sure about this, Liv?	1																					
99	103		204							1																								
100	97		301								Liv	I am! I can do this!	2																					
101	98		301								Lucia	Aright, but report your status all the time, and don't engage when you encounter enemies. Browning's frame is not at its best, so when you see anything dangerous, you can't... I'm pestering you, aren't I?	1																					
102	101		204							2	1																							
103	99		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Lucia and Lee, you shouldn't overextend yourselves either. Don't forget that Commandant is by your side.	2
