14	12		301								Ayla	Selena, you there...?	1																					
15	13		202							1					1																			
16	14		301									The interior of the cabin is barely visible under the dim emergency lights.																						
17	15		301									A terminal near the wall is still running. It displays many charts and data.

22	19		301									The terminal's control panel has been ripped off, with a few connectors plugged in. On the other side of the cables...

28	25		301							1	Ayla	Selena...	1																					
29	26		301									Ayla puts her scythe down. She slowly approaches and crouches downβ€”

44	41		301									Selena's sound unit seems to have been heavily damaged. Her voice comes out bitter and strange.																						
45	42		301									As if she is concerned about her voice, she no longer makes any sound.																						
46	43		201							1	500110																							
47	44		301							1	Ayla	Don't worry, Selena. I'll run some checks now, and I'll bring you back. We can get you a new body then.	1																					
48	45		301									Ayla starts to check Selena's various body functions.																						
49	46		301								Ayla	...	1																					
50	47		301									Fortunately, Selena is a support-type Construct; so her infection level was kept under the threshold.																						
51	48		301									Ayla believes that Selena's strong will to survive must have also helped.																						
52	49		301								Ayla	Great, looks like you will last until we get home.	1																					
53	50		301									Ayla looks at Selena, then the terminal that she is connected to.																						
54	51		301								Ayla	Did you survive only because of the energy from this space station terminal...?																						
55	52		301									How Selena struggled through many dark days was beyond Ayla's imagination.																						
56	53		301								Ayla	Right, the song...	1																					
57	54		301								Ayla	You connected yourself to the terminal, then added your song to the interference signal broadcasted by the space station...	1																					
58	55		301								Ayla	That's how you did it, right? Selena, you must've been waiting for me to notice...	1

66	63		202							1					1																			
67	64		301									Just when Ayla is about to unplug Selena from the terminal...																						
68	65		301									The terminal screen changes.																						
69	66		201							1	500110																							
70	67		301							1	Ayla	This is... the space station's database...	1																					
71	68		301								Ayla	And surveillance camera footage... Wait, is this Gray Raven?	1																					
72	69		202							1					1																			
73	70		301									Gray Raven members can be seen on the ring of the gravity room. They looked clueless.

75	72		301							1	Ayla	Selena... Do you want me to help them?	1
