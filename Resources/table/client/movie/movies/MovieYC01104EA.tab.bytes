6	5		301								Chrome	Ugh... But what was I going after? And why?	2																					
7	6		301								Chrome	And... what's this place?	2																					
8	7		301								John	It's our home. Why are you zoning out, Chrome?	3																					
9	8		301								Chrome	Mr. Smith...?	2																					
10	9		301								John	Call me father. I told you that a long time ago. Have you forgotten?	3

14	600		204							2	9																							
15	13		301								Chrome	A day off? Out of the questionâ€”wait, what did you just call me, Kamui?	2																					
16	14		301								Kamui	Commandant. What, you prefer Chrome instead? I don't mind that!	3																					
17	15		301								Chrome	No. I'm not a commandant. I'm your leader!	2																					
18	16		301								Chrome	I'm the leader of Strike Hawk!	2																					
19	17		301								Kamui	You must still be dreaming. The leader of Strike Hawk is Wanshi. You're our commandant!	3																					
20	18		301									Kamui suddenly appears anxious at Chrome's behavior. He begins shouting for help.																						
21	19		301								Kamui	Wanshi! I think Commandant's gone nuts!	3																					
22	20		301									â€”																						
23	21		301								Kamui	Wanshi!	3																					
24	22		301								Wanshi	I hear you! In that case, fix him before you bring him out here!																						
25	23		301								Kamui	This guy is still slacking off even though he's the leader now! Let's give the guy a good scolding, eh, Commandant?	3																					
26	24		301								Chrome	I'm not your commandant. And why is my body like this?	2																					
27	25		301								Chrome	Where's my Inver-Device? I should be a Construct.	2																					
28	26		301								Kamui	Uh, Chrome, what exactly happened to you?	3																					
29	27		301								Chrome	I should be the one asking this question! I should be a Construct! After I failed the commandant exam, I submitted the application to become a Construct...	2

37	35		301							1	Kamui	Yes. And then you became commandant of the Strike Hawk squad and we defeated countless enemies! We're only a few steps away from recovering Earth!	1																					
38	36		301									To help Chrome jog his memory, Chrome's father, Kamui, and all the others who arrive later fill him in on all that's happened.																						
39	37		202							1	2	3			1																			
40	38		301									His father has always been good to him. Chrome became a commandant through his own choice and hard work.																						
41	39		301									Right after that, he commanded the Strike Hawk squad to fight against the Corrupted and reclaimed the fallen regions on Earth. It then ended in a battle with the Ascendants.																						
42	40		301									In the end, victory was theirs. Everyone is outside waiting for him. The world is out thereâ€”a world in which no one has to suffer.																						
43	41		201							1	1081001	2																						
44	42		301							1	Kamui	Let's go then, Chrome. Now that you remember, it's time for our final mission.	1

47	45		301							1	Chrome	True... Can you guys wait outside for me for a bit? I'll get changed and be right here.	1																					
48	46		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Once everyone's gone, the room is back to a blankâ€”except for the door that connects the inside to the outside, the only thing that is clearly outlined.

54	52		301								Chrome	What about you, Chrome?	3																					
55	53		301								Chrome	I'll go this way.	2																					
56	54		301									Two similar yet vastly different souls sit together, back to back, seeing entirely different worlds.																						
57	55		301								Chrome	That's a difficult path, Chrome.	3																					
58	56		301								Chrome	All things are.	2																					
59	57		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And he goes.
