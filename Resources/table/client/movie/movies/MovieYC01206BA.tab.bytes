5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Luna	Sister, are you okay?	2																					
6	6		301								Î±	Not an issue. The virus will patch me up.	1																					
7	7		301								Luna	But Sister, why didn't you stop her? You could have stopped that explosion, right?	2																					
8	8		301								Î±	I wanted to see what she's got, what she's doing to win.	1																					
9	9		301								Î±	Those eyes... grew stronger than before.	1																					
10	10		301								Luna	Same with my other Sister too. She had the same eyes.	2																					
11	11		301								Î±	But not enough strength. Not enough to live.	1																					
12	12		301								Luna	So is this your way of "filtering" for the virus? We all operate on different grounds...	2																					
13	13		301								Î±	I have no interest in the "filtering," Luna. At the end of the day, who gave us the right?	1																					
14	14		301									Alpha seems to be intentionally avoiding this topic. She looks away from Luna, and at the still-crumbling Kowloong.

17	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Î±	You too, Luna.	1

26	27		301								Diana	Oh, thank heavens...	2																					
27	28		301									Rosetta opens her eyes again to find herself in the city, with Diana hugging her tight, and the other Forest Guards standing around her.																						
28	29		301								Rosetta	You all...	1																					
29	30		301									Though burning with curiosity for the current situation, and puzzled by the company of Forest Guard who should have been sent away by her, Rosetta receives her answer before she could even ask her question.																						
30	31		301									The faces of Diana and the others are full of worry and anger. Seeing this, Rosetta realizes what happened, and cannot help but let out a minimal chuckle.																						
31	32		301								Rosetta	How has everyone been? Same as before?	1																					
32	33		301								Diana	We all grew. A lot. Everything is getting better, Rosetta. We no longer live in hatred.	2																					
33	34		301								Rosetta	I wonder though... How will this battle end...?	1																					
34	35		301									The people in the city, like Rosetta, are all waiting for the outcome of the battle. Their expressions shift and reflect off of the wall of light, when suddenly a trail flashes beyond and within.																						
35	36		301									Diana tightens her embrace around Rosetta, as if to stop her from escaping.																						
36	37		301								Rosetta	...Sorry.	1																					
37	38		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Diana	No next time, Rosetta.	2
