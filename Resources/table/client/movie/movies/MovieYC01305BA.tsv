3	3		301			DialogEnable						Roland is lying leisurely on the Ferris wheel, juggling his chain blade out of boredom.																						
4	4		301									Suddenly, he pauses. He stands and straightens himself, looking at the sky.																						
5	6		201							1	500008																							
6	7		301							1	Roland	Ha! Those gray birdlings really took the bait.	1																					
7	8		301									And on the other end, Shome exits the aircraft and deplanes on the beach. He heads in the direction of the theme park.																						
8	9		301									Roland, at a vantage point, takes it all under his eye. He stretches lazily, then casually leaves the Ferris wheel and heads in Shome's direction.																						
9	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Finally. Our main dish.	1

13	610		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After Roland and Camu's fight.																						
14	609		201							1	500008																							
15	612		301							1	Roland	Let's see how long you can keep barking like that.	1																					
16	607		301									Roland turns away from the incapacitated Camu and exits.																						
17	608		301									Leaving only Camu, now leaning on his greatsword, barely staying on his feet.																						
18	30		301							1	Roland	Ah. Right. Here, have a parting gift. No need to thank me.	1																					
19	31		301									Roland stops in his tracks and turns, lifting his gun and pointing it at Camu. He fires—but Camu easily dodges the moment he pulled the trigger.																						
20	32		301									...But the shot was not meant to maim, instead, a robust-looking chain trails from the bullet. It eats into the wall of the theme park behind Camu.																						
21	33		301								Roland	Bye-bye, bothersome boyos.	1																					
22	34		202							1																								
23	35		301									Roland tugs on the chain rope and it retracts, bringing him out of Camu's attacking distance.																						
24	36		401							2	10007502																							
25	37		301			RImgBg1Shake	AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland presses a remote in his arms midair. Violent explosions flare up all over the park.																						
26	38		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory187.png																								
27	39		201							1	500008																							
28	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Roland	Phew.	1																					
29	41		301									After releasing the chain rope, Roland lands inside the theme park. The usual smirk is nowhere to be found on Roland's face. Anger, barely suppressed, is causing his body to tremble.																						
30	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	The rest is in your hands, big guy.	1

35	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Violent tremors pulsate from the ground, but even the sound of explosions cannot drown out the screams of chaotic self-expansion, let out by the infected energy center.																						
36	48		201							1	500101																							
37	49		301							1	Gabriel	Looks like Roland has made contact with the target.	1																					
38	50		301								Gabriel	Then our prey should be arriving soon...	1																					
39	51		202							1																								
40	52		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Gabriel hides, waiting in the shadows for Shome.																						
41	53		201							1	500184																							
42	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Shome	Roland is here... They found out, huh...	1																					
43	55		301								Shome	But no matter. The Babylonians will slow him down.	1																					
44	56		301								Shome	As long as I complete my experiment before he catches up to me, I can turn the tables.	1																					
45	57		301									Shome readjusts his glasses. Now at the control room of the energy center, his hands are tapping swiftly on the screen. However, Shome soon stills his hands.																						
46	58		301								Shome	...Hm? The production line should have activated right away. Damn it... the disuse must have caused a jam somewhere...	1																					
47	59		301								Shome	This won't do. I might not make it...	1																					
48	60		203							1	0.25	-400																						
49	61		201							2	500101		400																					
50	62		301							1	Gabriel	Allow me to apologize. I am sorry for modifying your grandfather's legacy without permission.	2																					
51	63		301									Gabriel walks out of the shadows, appearing behind Shome.																						
52	64		301								Shome	What? It's you!	1																					
53	65		301									Ignoring Shome's surprise, Gabriel straightforwardly continues.																						
54	66		301								Gabriel	Why... did you come here?	2																					
55	67		301								Shome	...	1																					
56	68		301									Shome quickly scans his surroundings for an escape in silence. Gabriel notices, but decides to allow him to liberty. With Gabriel standing guard before the exit of the control room, Shome has no place to run.																						
57	69		301								Shome	Will you help me if I tell you?	1																					
58	70		301								Gabriel	Naturally... No.	2																					
59	71		301								Shome	It won't hurt to listen.	1																					
60	72		301								Shome	Besides, you've already turned this place into a dead zone. This saves us one step.	1																					
61	73		301								Gabriel	It is only done for ease of control, and to shut out foreign parties.	2																					
62	74		301								Shome	Yes, but, the self-expanding machinery also provide us Ascendants with tremendous computing power. With proper modifications, this place can become the highest-output factory for machines.	1																					
63	75		301								Shome	You are interested in machine modification, yes? We are all trying to break our limits. You and me, together with the data I have, we can complete the experiment 60 percent faster.	1																					
64	76		401							2	10007502																							
65	77		301			RImgBg1Shake						Gabriel stretches out his hand and thumps it heavily on the wall of the control room. The entire room shakes from the tremendous impact.																						
66	78		301								Gabriel	The way you stall, weakling, is as obvious as ever.	2																					
67	79		301									Hearing Gabriel, Shome forces a weak smile and readjusts his glasses.																						
68	80		301								Shome	Well, well. Let's see who is the weakling.	1																					
69	83		301								Gabriel	?!	2																					
70	84		401							2	1506																							
71	85		202							1	2				1																			
72	86		301			RImgBg1Shake						The floor of the control room crumbles. Unable to react in time, Gabriel falls to the bottom of the energy center along with the broken floor.																						
73	87		301									During the descent, Gabriel sees that only the floor in front of the control panel remains intact, and Shome is standing on that part of the floor and looking down at him.																						
74	88		201							1	500184																							
75	89		301							1	Shome	My grandfather left me this theme park. Of course there'd be secret features only I know.	1																					
76	90		301								Shome	Well then. Farewell.	1																					
77	91		301									Gabriel flips in mid air, and black wings metal unfold from his back, slowly his descent into a halt. He hovers steadily in the air.																						
78	92		301									He then swings his arm and hurls his cane up.																						
79	93		301								Shome	Tsk.	1																					
80	94		401							2	10008001																							
81	95		301			RImgBg1Shake						Gabriel's cane cuts past Shome's cheek, and nails firmly into the wall behind him. The wind from the cane cuts Shome's artificial skin, and vital fluid seeps from his wound.																						
82	96		301								Shome	Looks like my peace and quiet will have to wait until they're all dealt with.	1																					
83	97		301									Seeing Gabriel flying, Shome quickly pivots and taps on the screen in the control room. He retrieves a light-blue, rectangular chip from under the screen.																						
84	98		301								Shome	It's all on her now...	1																					
85	99		202							1																								
86	100		301									At that, Shome bolts out of the control room and heads for the surface.																						
87	101		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Dodging the crumbling floor tiles, Gabriel eventually reaches the control room. He lands and straightens his coat, then leaves in pursuit of Shome.																						
88	102		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory190.png																								
89	103		201							1	500184																							
90	104		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Shome	Damn it, the explosion blocked most of the exits.	1																					
91	105		301									Shome checks the map of the energy center projected on his glasses. Vibrations from behind him tells him that the traps he set were not of much use.																						
92	106		301								Shome	Good thing the elevator up ahead is still accessible.	1																					
93	107		201							1	500101																							
94	108		301							1	Gabriel	...	1																					
95	109		201							1	500184																							
96	110		301							1	Shome	Tch, a quick one, eh?	1																					
97	111		301								Shome	Turret modules, activate. Disengage the guard security locks... Go, stop that monster.	1																					
98	112		201							1	500013

102	116		301							1	Corrupted	—!	1	2	3																			
103	117		202							1	2	3			1																			
104	118		301									A horde of Corrupted pour out from the corridor that Shome just passed. They all charge in Gabriel's direction.																						
105	119		201							1	500101																							
106	120		301							1	Gabriel	A futile struggle.	1																					
107	121		401							2	10007502																							
108	122		301									One of the Corrupted launches itself at Gabriel. He dodges by shifting to the side, as the Corrupted passes by, Gabriel punches it and hammers it into the wall of the corridor.																						
109	123		301			RImgBg1Shake						Then Gabriel plucks a Corrupted from the horde and crushes it into a ball. He hurls it at the incoming Corrupted, and most of them topple and collapse from the impact.																						
110	124		301									After the Corrupted fall, multiple machine guns emerge from the walls of the corridor.																						
111	125		301								Gabriel	Cosmos 9735 HMG. A bullet of this caliber cannot penetrate my body.	1																					
112	126		401							2	10001004																							
113	127		301									Gabriel merely marches ahead, allowing the bullets to rain down upon him. Smoke and gunfire fog up the narrow corridor. The smoke soon clears, revealing only tripods buzzing with sparks, the HMGs nowhere to be seen.																						
114	128		301									In the corridor, Gabriel stands still, looking at the escaping direction of Shome.																						
115	129		301								Gabriel	Everything will end here, through a spectacular finale.	1																					
116	130		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Tossing the wrenched out machine guns aside, Gabriel exits through the corridor.

121	135		202							1																								
122	136		301									Shome stumbles out of the elevator, and quickly taps the control panel of the elevator.																						
123	137		401							2	1515																							
124	138		301								System	Elevator lockdown procedure, activating. Lockdown complete.																						
125	139		301									Confirming that the elevator is disabled, Shome turns and leans on the control panel, slowly crumbling to the floor.																						
126	140		301									Looking around the plaza, everything here just like the blueprint his grandfather had shown him. The central statue of Shark-speare is playing a pre-set children's song on a loop.																						
127	141		201							1	500177																							
128	142		301							1	Shark-speare	Let's play!	1																					
129	143		301								Shark-speare	Shark-speare loves gingerbread men!	1																					
130	144		201							1	500184																							
131	145		301							1	Shome	Pant... pant...	1																					
132	146		301									After a few deep breaths, Shome finally calms down. He stands and walks toward the giant statue in the center.																						
133	147		301								Shome	Looks like I made it. Next, I just have to activate the statue to buy me more time for escape...	1																					
134	148		301								???	Going somewhere?																						
135	149		301								Shome	?!	1																					
136	150		202							1																								
137	151		301									An imposing female voice rings out from behind the statue. It is a familiar voice, and one that Shome fears greatly.																						
138	152		301									Small beads of sweat seep out from his synth-skin. Fear instinctively dominates his body. Without a second thought, Shome turns and bolts.																						
139	153		301									Against Roland and Gabriel, Shome would still dare dream of a reversal against all hope. But with Luna, only one thought occupies his mind—RUN.																						
140	154		201							1	500101																							
141	155		301							1	Gabriel	Why aren't you answering Miss Luna's question?	1																					
142	156		401							2	1512																							
143	157		301			RImgBg1Shake						Gabriel, somehow, is already standing in the way of Shome's escape route. Before he could even react, Gabriel takes a step forward and launches a blow at his abdomen.																						
144	158		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Shome falls to his knees from the blow. Footsteps approach him from behind, and he knows—everything is over.
