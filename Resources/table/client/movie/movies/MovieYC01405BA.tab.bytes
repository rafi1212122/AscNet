5	5		202							1																								
6	6		301									Ever since the angry bear model and his supporters left, Nanami has been as still as a rock. Feeling like an eternity has passed, Martin decides to pat Nanami on her shoulder.																						
7	7		201							1	500091																							
8	8		301							1	Nanami	WA, HA, HA ,HA!	1																					
9	9		201							1	500211																							
10	10		301							1	Martin	...What are you on again, Nanami...	1																					
11	11		201							1	500091	1																						
12	12		301							1	Nanami	This! Helps me! Get my! Spirits up!	1																					
13	13		201							1	500211																							
14	14		301							1	Martin	Alright. Guess we're still trying to make peace, then?	1																					
15	15		201							1	500091	1																						
16	16		301							1	Nanami	Of course! You can't stop Nanami with a big ol' reason stick or a ten episode backstory! Nanami wants something done—she gets it done!	1																					
17	17		301								Nanami	...I get where the bionics were coming from. But it just ain't right fighting in this place! Not to mention the Corrupted!	1																					
18	18		201							1	500211																							
19	19		301							1	Martin	Punishing Virus, huh... We bionics don't really know what's going on about it.	1																					
20	20		202							1																								
21	21		301									The bionics rarely come into contact with the Corrupted. Even if knowledge of the virus exists in their databanks, their experience tells them that it is nothing to be feared.																						
22	22		201							1	500091	8																						
23	23		301							1	Nanami	You'll be deader than a linguine if the virus gets hold of you! That's even ickier stuff than Amberia's mind control or whatever!	1																					
24	24		201							1	500211																							
25	25		301							1	Martin	...Which means we should catch up to those who just left, right? Or do we go find the Corrupted instead?	1																					
26	26		201							1	500091	1																						
27	27		301							1	Nanami	Hmm... It'd take too long. Nanami is going with her original plan!	1																					
28	28		301									At this, Nanami looks around the settlement. Finally finding a suitable Nanami-rock, she climbs atop and uses it as a pedestal.																						
29	29		301								Nanami	Ahem! Bionics of Nanarmy! Lookie here!	1																					
30	30		201							1	500211																							
31	31		301							1	Martin	What on earth is a Nanarmy?!	1																					
32	32		201							1	500208																							
33	33		301							1	Bionic Machine	Yeah?	1																					
34	34		202							1																								
35	35		301									Nanami's order draws the attention of all the bionics.																						
36	36		201							1	500091	1																						
37	37		301							1	Nanami	Ol' Martin here's hit his head and forgotten the whereabouts of Amberia, but y'all here must know something, right?!	1																					
38	38		201							1	500208																							
39	39		301							1	Bionic Machine	Yeah. We do... And?	1																					
40	40		201							1	500091	1																						
41	41		301							1	Nanami	I'm gonna go convince Amberia to stop the bionics from attacking humans, then we can all go figure out what the Corrupted are up to!	1																					
42	42		201							1	500208																							
43	43		301							1	Bionic Machine	But our mother-frame... Amberia, she's always been in a slumber. I don't even know if you can converse with her, not to mention...	1																					
44	44		201							1	500091																							
45	45		301							1	Nanami	Not to mention...?	1																					
46	46		201							1	500208																							
47	47		301							1	Bionic Machine	We're staying behind because we're sick of fighting. But those who left were right—we feel the same anger inside.	1																					
48	48		301								Bionic Machine	So... you can't just ask us to work against them...	1																					
49	49		201							1	500091																							
50	50		301							1	Nanami	But, all the bionics are fighting for Amberia, right? If Amberia wants everyone to stop, they'll listen, yeah?	1																					
51	51		201							1	500208																							
52	52		301							1	Bionic Machine	Well... Yeah...	1																					
53	53		201							1	500091	1																						
54	54		301							1	Nanami	If Nanami can't pass Amberia's diplomacy check, I'll think of another way... But now, let's get the dice rolling first!	1																					
55	55		202							1																								
56	56		301									Hearing Nanami's firm and confident tone, the bionics form a ring to discuss among themselves. Martin is dragged inside.																						
57	57		301									Shortly, Martin is pushed out.																						
58	58		201							1	500211																							
59	59		301							1	Martin	Nanami, Amberia is sleeping in an underground place nearby! Let's go!	1																					
60	60		201							1	500091	1																						
61	61		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Nanami	Huehue. Well then, Nanarmy... roll out!	1
