4	4		301									The pale blue planet before him takes up most of the porthole view, slowly rotating. He observes in silence.																						
5	5		301									A peculiar atmosphere filled the bridge; the crew rarely saw Hassen's quiet side.																						
6	6		301									Hassen was one to always make his presence known, whether it was issuing orders, formulating tactics, or even if it is just to keep others in high spirits.																						
7	7		301									This is not the usual Hassen. The only thing the crew could see, are the thin outline of his neck and the gray tufts of hair.																						
8	8		301									Flustered, Celica begins to hear whispers around her as icons and documents pass before her eyes. The voices begin to fill her head with a cacophonous roar.																						
9	9		301									Supply lists, troop mobilizations, power negotiations... Reports, maps sent by reconnaissance, grey market transactions with the Forsaken, and intel mandates for Akdilek...																						
10	10		301									Celica scans the various technical documents with her eyepiece, selecting key intel to be reduced into 200-word reports. Hassen has no time for the details, so she must ensure that everything is complete and correct.

36	36		301									Hassen turns to face Celica, but his face reveals an expression she had never seen from him before.																						
37	37		301									Vacant, hesitant, perhaps even a hint of fearâ€”if Celica had to describe his expression, it would be like if someone killed for the first time.																						
38	38		301									The expression fades from Hassen's face in the blink of an eye. He returns to normal, as if nothing had ever happened.

40	40		301								Hassen	Got it.	2																					
41	41		301								Celica	However, I've already given them a once-over. There aren't any urgent documents that require an immediate response from you today.	1

43	43		301								Hassen	I see...	2																					
44	44		301									Hassen shows a noncommittal expression. He raises his head slightly, as if trying to persuade himself to Celica's proposal.																						
45	45		301								Celica	I'm serious, President. How much sleep did you get last night?	1																					
46	46		301								Hassen	...I didn't get any.	2

48	48		301								Celica	...Please, go get some sleep.	1																					
49	49		301								Hassen	That's not necessary.	2

51	51		301								Celica	Please, go get some sleep.	1																					
52	52		301								Hassen	But I still have 76 decision reports to process. Right?	2																					
53	53		301								Celica	None of which require a response from you today.	1																					
54	54		301								Hassen	...Alright, if you insist.	2																					
55	55		301									With that, Hassen snatches the encrypted terminal from Celica's hand and stuffs it into his pocket.																						
56	56		301								Hassen	I'll process these lying down. That'll count as rest.	2

64	64		301								Nikola	I brought something that you need to look at immediately.	1																					
65	65		301									Nikola raises the hard drive in his hand. A bright red "Top Secret" seal is visible on it.

127	127		301								Staessen	This will just barely pull the wool over Babylonia's eyes. As for the Forest Guard, sin will no longer coax them into serving the ARU. We must treat them with kindness.	1

226	210		301									While Staessen tries to ease the sailors, he suddenly notices the research director leaving the settlement accompanied by several people in white coats.																						
227	211		204							1	5																							
228	212		301								Staessen	Halt! Kaplan! Where do you think you're going?	1																					
229	213		203							1	0.25	-400																						
230	214		201							2	500138		400																					
231	215		301							1	Research Director	Are you joking? Who'd want to die in this pathetic excuse of a settlement?	2																					
232	216		301								Research Director	I'm going to the research institute for a while, and then I'm going south in search of Akdilek.	2																					
233	217		301								Staessen	Are you joking?!	1																					
234	218		301								Research Director	What makes you think I'm joking?! I don't know what you're up against, but it has nothing to do with me.	2																					
235	219		301								Staessen	...Damn you! Kaplan!	1																					
236	220		301								Research Director	Staessen, since when did you think... we were equals?	2																					
237	221		204							1																								
238	222		301								Staessen	...	1																					
239	223		301								Research Director	...Hmph. Do as you please. I'm leaving.	2																					
240	224		301								Staessen	...Coward.	1																					
241	225		202							2					1																			
242	226		203							1	0.25																							
243	227		204							1																								
244	228		301									Hearing Staessen's response, the research director gives him a menacing glare, then turns to leave.																						
245	229		301								Sailor	Captain...																						
246	230		301								Staessen	...I'm sorry you had to see that. Anyways, let's do all we can.	1																					
247	231		301								Staessen	And he reminded me... The walls of the institute are interlayed with armor for defense purposes. He has a key to open the armored door, but so do I.	1																					
248	232		301								Staessen	If he doesn't care, neither do I... If we can't maintain the defensive line, then we will retreat into the research institute as well.	1																					
249	233		301								Sailor	...Understood. What about the elderly and children who have difficulty moving?																						
250	234		301								Staessen	Evacuate them to the refugee shelters beneath the old theater. The three rooms should be able to comfortably hold over a hundred people.	1																					
251	235		301								Staessen	If we win, we'll let them out. If we lose... Someone will let them out, eventually.	1																					
252	236		301								Sailor	...That's the best we can do.																						
253	237		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Staessen	Damn it, why do I still gotta foot the bill for this mess...	1																					
254	238		202							1					1																			
255	239		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						(30 minutes later.)																						
256	240		301									The battle has ended before it even begins, leaving Staessen stupefied over their current situation.																						
257	241		301									All they can see are melted buildings, punctured steel, exploded ammunition, and bodies evaporated by light.																						
258	242		301									They do not even know how the barricades and bunkers disintegrated, or how that devastating white light melted half of the air control tower like butter.																						
259	243		301									Staessen and all of those still standing could do nothing but retreat to the safety of the research institute.																						
260	244		301									The white figure maintains pursuit, never too far, never too close. Why is she here? What for? Staessen no longer cares anymore. He has long since lost the strength to do so.																						
261	245		301									Livingâ€”that is the only concern in his mind right now.																						
262	246		201							1	500199	5																						
263	247		301							1	Staessen	Let's go!	1																					
264	248		202							1					1																			
265	249		301								Second Mate	Retreat into the bunker!																						
266	250		202							1					1																			
267	251		401							2	10007502																							
268	252		301			RImgBg1Shake						Amid flames and explosions, the group moves along the ruins for cover all the way to the nearby research institute.																						
269	253		301								Second Mate	Captain... What are we going to do when we get there? We don't stand a chance against her.																						
270	254		201							1	500199																							
271	255		301								Staessen	Heh... That Kaplan won't stay calm.	1																					
272	256		301								Staessen	As soon as danger approaches, he'll play the ace up his sleeve.	1																					
273	257		202							1					1																			
274	258		301									Then, just like Staessen foretold, several turrets and missile launchers protrude from the wall of the institute and begin firing at Luna. Explosions and smoke envelop her in an instant.																						
275	259		401							2	10001004																							
276	260		401							2	10007502																							
277	261		301									...																						
278	262		301			RImgBg1Shake						The turrets continue to bombard the area in an unending stream of explosions.																						
279	263		201							1	500199																							
280	264		301							1	Second Mate	Captain? What do we do now?																						
281	265		301								Staessen	What else is there to do? While they're busy fighting, we run.	1																					
282	266		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As the bombardment continues, Staessen and the others make their way to the research institute entrance. Staessen inputs the key code, then everyone enters the elevator and proceeds underground.																						
283	267		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
284	268		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Staessen	Alright, we'll be safe underground.	1																					
285	269		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Staessen	Once the fighting is over outside, we'll look for Kaplan... Then we'll make him payâ€”slowly.	1																					
286	270		202							1					1																			
287	271		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory250.png																								
288	272		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
289	273		301									Captain...																						
290	274		201							1	500199																							
291	275		301							1	Staessen	Yes?	1																					
292	276		301								Second Mate	Where... are we?																						
293	277		301								Staessen	This is the safest place in the entire research institute and where the armor plating is thickest. This place isn't on the map.	1																					
294	278		301								Staessen	...It's where the institute conducted preliminary screenings for test subjects. In other words, it's an... execution chamber.	1																					
295	279		301								Second Mate	...What did you say?																						
296	280		301								Staessen	See these pillars? Kaplan and the others tell them that this is the "Reception Hall of Peace". When the time comes, test subjects were taken into the sealed observation room and then... injected with experimental drugs.	1																					
297	281		301								Staessen	Just like that, they would filter out the most suitable test subjects from over 200 people to proceed onto the next phase.	1																					
298	282		301								Staessen	That Kaplan must be in the observation room as we speak.	1																					
299	283		301								Second Mate	Captain, how do you know this place so well? Did you...																						
300	284		301									The second mate begins to raise his voice, but Staessen rushes over to cover his mouth.																						
301	285		301								Staessen	Shhh...! Quiet! He's busy dealing with that monster right now. He won't have the time to check what's going on behind the observation room... So, we can sneak in once the battle subsides. Got it?	1																					
302	286		301								Second Mate	Mm! Mm...																						
303	287		301								Staessen	Keep quiet, and I'll let go.	1																					
304	288		301								Second Mate	...How much do you really know?																						
305	289		301								Staessen	Well, I... I didn't help them kill anyone.	1																					
306	290		301								Second Mate	...When this is all over, Captain, you have a lot to confess.																						
307	291		301								Staessen	...	1																					
308	292		401							2	10007502																							
309	293		301			RImgBg1Shake					Second Mate	What's that?!																						
310	294		301								Staessen	This can't be...	1																					
311	295		301								Staessen	There... There are six floors of armored plating disguised as steel structures... Even railguns shouldn't be able to...	1																					
312	296		401							2	10007502																							
313	297		301			RImgBg1Shake					Staessen	...What on Earth are we up against...	1																					
314	298		301								Second Mate	It's coming from the wall in the direction of the observation room!																						
315	299		301								Staessen	Hurry! Hide behind the pillars!	1																					
316	300		202							1					1																			
317	301		301									Just as Staessen and the others hide behind the pillars, the wall in the direction of the observation room begins to glow red and blister right before their eyes.																						
318	302		401							2	10007502																							
319	303		301			RImgBg1Shake						Then an explosion shoots fragments throughout the hall like a shotgun blast. The three pillars take the brunt of the damage.																						
320	304		301									A black mass is thrown into the hall as the terrifying and familiar white figure floats in.																						
321	305		201							1	500199																							
322	306		301							1	Staessen	(...It's Kaplan!)	1																					
323	307		202							1																								
324	308		301									The remaining half of the man thrown onto the ground is wrapped in a white coat, lying amid the wreckage of concrete and steel.																						
325	309		201							1	500138																							
326	310		301							1	Research Director	Huff, puff...	1																					
327	311		301								Research Director	What... What is it you want?! I'll give you anything!	1																					
328	312		201							1	500238	8																						
329	313		301							1	Luna	That won't be necessary. How lucky I must be... You telling me about this place... is more than enough.	1																					
330	314		301								Luna	I have already found what I am looking for.	1																					
331	315		202							1					1																			
332	316		301									Luna shifts her gaze from the languishing body on the ground to the remnants of the three pillars.																						
333	317		201							1	500138																							
334	318		301							1	Research Director	...?	1																					
335	319		201							1	500238	8																						
336	320		301							1	Luna	You are of no use to me now.	1																					
337	321		301									Luna waves her hand to summon the railgun. The frightened man drags the remnants of his body toward the pillars.																						
338	322		201							1	500138																							
339	323		301							1	Research Director	No! Please! No!	1																					
340	324		201							1	500238	8																						
341	325		301							1	Luna	Why are you running? You know it is meaningless.	1																					
342	326		301									Having said that, Luna makes no attempt at stopping the desperately crawling man. Nor does she even aim the railgun at him. It seems as if she is waiting for something.																						
343	327		201							1	500138																							
344	328		301							1		The research director finally climbs to a half collapsed pillar, but just as he is about to seek cover behind it, he sees Staessen hiding behind one of the pillars.																						
345	329		301								Research Director	...You...	1																					
346	330		202							1																								
347	331		301									But right at that moment, a white beam of destruction devours him.																						
348	332		201							1	500238	8																						
349	333		301							1	Luna	Come out. Don't think you can hide from me.	1																					
350	334		201							1	500199																							
351	335		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Staessen	...	1
