3	3		301			DialogEnable						Roland walks through the town, following the clumsy but straight-forward messages left by the unknown opponents.																						
4	4		301									They seem to have realized that Roland cannot be stopped by the trivial attempts. Apart from the occasional few that quickly vanished in sight, Roland no longer sees any Corrupted in front of him.

6	6		301							1	Roland	...	1																					
7	7		301									Roland silently walks on the street, following the awkwardly painted graffiti and directions.																						
8	8		301									The stone paved road is still wet from previous spring showers. His metal heels knock on the stone, leaving echoes in the ruins.																						
9	9		202							1					1																			
10	10		301									Until he sees a white figure walking to a deserted but mostly undamaged mansion located deep inside the town.																						
11	11		301									It has stopped in front of the mansion and seems to be waiting for Roland.																						
12	12		201							1	500334																							
13	13		301							1	Roland	(...They chose here of all the places. They really know it...)	1																					
14	14		301									It cannot be wrong. This is "Luna's home."																						
15	15		301									That being said, she only lived here while she was still a human. She left this place at a very young age.																						
16	16		301									Still, Roland is reassured that the opponents aren't simply hunting for himâ€”they know very well what this place is all about.																						
17	17		301								Roland	(Whatever awaits me inside, I must check it out.)	1																					
18	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland quietly walks to the white figure, who is waiting outside the door.

22	22		301									Roland walks to the white figure and realizes it is a Corrupted. It just stands still without giving further information.																						
23	23		201							1	500334																							
24	24		301							1	Roland	...Tsk, you got me here, and stopped working.	1																					
25	25		301									With one gentle poke, the Corrupted's joints lose all strength and it collapses to the ground.																						
26	26		301								Roland	Time to find out what they want me here for...	1																					
27	27		201							1	500165																							
28	28		301							1	???	Dammit, they just keep coming... Eek?	1																					
29	29		201							1	500334																							
30	30		301							1	Roland	?	1																					
31	31		301									Roland is observing the mansion and trying to find a relatively peaceful way inside, but the street next to him suddenly gets noisy.																						
32	32		301									Soon, a large shadow rushes out with a few Corrupted clinging to it.																						
33	33		201							1	500165

35	35		201							1	500334																							
36	36		301							1		...It's not surprising that Lamia isn't good at close quarter combat, considering her significantly disproportional body.

48	48		301								Roland	...?	1																					
49	49		301									Seeing Roland is confused, Lamia doesn't want to talk about it further. She quickly speaks again.																						
50	50		301								Lamia	I... I saw them...	2																					
51	51		301								Roland	?	1

57	57		301									Lamia enters the town from the upper route using the forest as a cover.

59	59		301							1	Lamia	Alright, let me take a look from aboveâ€”	1

61	61		301							1	Noctis	C'mon, I checked! It might look scrappy, but the frame is still intact, and the engine still works...	1

67	67		301								Noctis	Fine, I'm not as petty as you. I trust your driving skill... It can't be as terrible as 21's, can it?	2

73	73		301									Vera pulls the door open, sits in the driver's seat, then slams the door shut. She rests her arm on the window and waves to the other side.

75	75		301								Vera	Commandantâ€”enjoy the thrill as a Cerberus!	1																					
76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301									The police car speeds away, leaving No. 21 and her Co-Bot behind.																						
78	78		301									Lamia watches the remaining Task Force member walk toward Roland's direction.																						
79	79		201							1	500165																							
80	80		301							1	Lamia	Two drove away, and the last one is heading to Roland...	1																					
81	81		301								Lamia	I need to tell him what happened...	1																					
82	82		301									Lamia eagerly tries to contact Roland, but a Jitterbomb quietly crawls to the roof next to her feet.																						
83	83		201							1	500314																							
84	84		301							1	???	...Turn back time.	1

94	94		401							2	10007502																							
95	95		301			RImgBg1Shake						The Jitterbomb fiercely explodes under Lamia, destroying the roof structure. Lamia loses her support and tumbles down the building.																						
96	96		301									â€”Landing right into a group of gathering Corrupted Constructs.

119	119		301									Roland is slightly anxious but excited after learning the news from Lamia

121	121		301								Roland	(I need to endure. Once all the parties have arrived... Then it will be my time to shine.)	1

131	131		301							1	Roland	I need to familiarize myself with the setting before they arrive.	1

135	135		301							1	Roland	By instinct? Or...	1																					
136	136		301								Roland	They must have a reason to let us see the Task Force and make me come here.	1																					
137	137		301								Roland	But only you and I get to decide when to move on to the next episode.	1																					
138	138		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	(This is the only way to confirm what I seek is real, not just my illusion.)	1
