16	16		301							1	Vera	Turn off your audio modules now!	1

20	20		301			RImgBg1Shake						No. 21 and Noctis are suddenly knocked back by an immense force one after another. Everyone loses their balance and drops their weapons, falling to the ground.

29	29		301							1	Roland	Marvelous... How wonderful.	1																					
30	30		301									Elegantly Roland steps up and takes off an invisible hat, bowing under the moon like a magician giving his curtain call.																						
31	31		301								Roland	Ta-da! The show is over!	1																					
32	32		301								Roland	What an opening act! You've saved me a lot of work, let me tell you that. As for the audience who tried to sneak in without a ticket... I think a little punishment is in order, no?	1																					
33	33		202							1					1																			
34	34		301									Roland did not try to imprison Voodoo though.																						
35	35		301									After fighting both Roland and Cerberus, she probably has no strength left.																						
36	36		301									At the same time, Roland can find more information through her reactionâ€”																						
37	37		301									â€”She did not attempt to run, which was a good sign. It means she was prepared to be defeated.																						
38	38		301									He walks to Voodoo, looking nothing like the frail loser moments ago.																						
39	39		201							1	500334	2																						
40	40		301							1	Roland	Now, can I have your ticket, please, ma'am?	1																					
41	41		301									He then moves closer and whispers in her earsâ€”																						
42	42		301								Roland	â€”Where's the other one? I don't talk to the henchman.	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	If you want me, get your boss to talk to me.	1

47	47		301								Roland	Where is he?	1																					
48	48		301								Voodoo	...You'll find out soon enough.	2																					
49	49		301								Roland	I don't like riddles.	1																					
50	50		401							2	1511																							
51	51		301									Roland points his gun at Voodoo's broken mask.																						
52	52		301								Roland	I have no idea why your designer put the core components of your M.I.N.D. in the head, making you no different from a human.	1																					
53	53		301								Roland	But that's easier for me. Without the armor on your mask, even a military-grade composite skull won't survive my shotgun.	1																					
54	54		301								Roland	So bring me the other one if you don't want to die.	1																					
55	55		301								Voodoo	...	2

62	62		201							2	500327	9	-400																					
63	63		301							1	Roland	Tsk, how boring.	1																					
64	64		301								Roland	Alright, we don't have much time, do we?	1																					
65	65		301								Roland	That Mister you keep talking about, take me to him.	1																					
66	66		301								Voodoo	I'm afraid I can't do that...	2																					
67	67		301								Roland	?	1																					
68	68		301								Voodoo	Because... I have to leave.	2																					
69	69		301								Voodoo	Starting back-up jet engine.	2																					
70	70		401							2	1509																							
71	71		301									A few thrusters suddenly appear under Voodoo's large black wings.																						
72	72		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryFireLiziNew.prefab	2																							
73	73		301									The flames and air currents push Voodoo into the air at an awkward angle.																						
74	74		301									Before she leaves Roland's firing range, her last words areâ€”																						
75	75		301								Voodoo	You'll change your mind once you meet him.	2																					
76	76		301								Voodoo	To people like you and me... That is the only place we get to enjoy ourselves...	2

80	80		301							1	Roland	Interesting... Very interesting...	1																					
81	81		301									What a fascinating plot, Roland thinks.																						
82	82		301								Roland	Haha... Hahaha... Hahahaha!	1																					
83	83		301									â€”Roland can't help but burst into laughter. He turns back and looks at No. 21, who is still pinned to the ground.																						
84	84		301									She seems to have felt Roland's mockery and disdain and makes a threatening growl. But it only makes Roland feel more sorry for her, and the Gray Raven Commandant.																						
85	85		301								Roland	Interesting... Commandant, I wonder what your face will look like when you find out the truth...	1																					
86	86		301								Roland	(The world is a dark place, as always. To me, and to you.)	1																					
87	87		301								Roland	(If only I have a chance... I wish I can chain you in front of me, so both of us poor souls can have a good talk.)	1																					
88	88		301									â€”But that's another story. Roland looks back at Voodooâ€”																						
89	89		301									She has already escaped into the sky. Roland searches around for the girl he saw earlier onâ€”																						
90	90		301									â€”But she has already disappeared without a sign, just like every past appearance of hers.																						
91	91		301								Roland	...Tsk, enough of this pretentious mystery.	1																					
92	92		301								Roland	Well, I've got to go too.	1																					
93	93		301								Roland	See you, good puppies.	1																					
94	94		202							1	2				1																			
95	95		301									Roland turns around and leaves the valley.																						
96	96		301									The helicopter noises are getting close. That's probably Babylonia's reinforcements.																						
97	97		301									Or maybe not? But Roland no longer cares.																						
98	98		301									Soon, Cerberus will find out that unlike the encounter at Venus Splash Park, this time they are only trapped by the electromagnetic constraints that he planted earlier on during the battle.																						
99	99		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But that's not for Roland to worry about.

103	103		301								Cinderelik	I see, you were defeated. Don't worry, that was also part of the plan.	1																					
104	104		301								Cinderelik	Yeah, just come back after that.	1																					
105	105		301								Cinderelik	I'll take over from here.	1																					
106	106		301								Cinderelik	...	1																					
107	107		301								Cinderelik	Mister wanted it this way.	1																					
108	108		301								Cinderelik	Okay.	1																					
109	109		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Cinderelik	It's not something you should worry about.	1
