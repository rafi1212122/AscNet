4	4		301									Infants never keep their memories.																						
5	5		301									The hippocampus and amygdala of the brain, which are essential for long-term memory, are still not fully developed during the infant stage. The memory links to various areas of the brain are constantly changing. Over time, such links are disconnected and memories will be lost.																						
6	6		301									But the dusted memories start to come back as she runs her fingers across the cold steel walls and goes deeper into the city.																						
7	7		301									It all started from a blazing white light.

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A corner of the medical department office has been separated by simple cardboard fences. The ground is covered by foam and plastic airbags that were originally used to wrap expensive devices.																						
14	14		301									A tiny, crippled figure is crawling inside the fence with two hands. There are no toys in the base, so the medical staff threw some cables, coffee cups and writing boards for her to play.

17	17		301							1	Lustrous	Why is she still here?	1																					
18	18		301								Medical Director	We were too busy when the last supply ship arrived. Plus, we never put things that are alive on our regular asset registration...	2																					
19	19		301								Lustrous	Are you going to send her back to the land through the cargo channel?	1																					
20	20		301								Lustrous	Whatever. Forget it.	1																					
21	21		301									Lustrous squats down to look at the crawling infant.																						
22	22		301								Lustrous	She's so ugly, like a monkey. Can we get her to stand up?	1																					
23	23		301								Medical Director	Yes, we can give her prosthetic lower limbs, but...	2																					
24	24		301									Lamia crawls to a pile of messy network cables and happily wraps it around her arm, like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn.																						
25	25		301								Lustrous	But what?	1																					
26	26		301								Medical Director	Her body is too young to take them.	2																					
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lustrous	Then wait until she's older.	1

32	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lustrous	Is there a risk?	1																					
33	34		301								Medical Director	Every surgery has its risks. Not to mention she's only a kid.	2																					
34	35		301								Lustrous	How certain are you?	1																					
35	36		301								Medical Director	I'll do my best.	2																					
36	37		301								Lustrous	Tell me your plan.	1																					
37	38		301								Medical Director	I'll make a fresh incision after anesthesia to expose the cross-section of her lower limbs. Then I will close the blood vessels, strip the nerve endings and connect the nerve endings to the electrodes of her prosthetic legs one by one. Finally, I will stitch up the wound and clean the excess tissue.	2																					
38	39		301								Medical Director	Why the sudden obsession with medical science? Are you concerned about this child?	2																					
39	40		301								Lustrous	Maybe, but mainly because this is a field I've never tapped into before. It's my... personal interest.	1																					
40	41		301								Medical Director	The operation isn't too difficult. You will be amazed by the Science Council's latest human modification technology.	2																					
41	42		301								Lustrous	Oh, really? You can tell me about it next time.	1																					
42	43		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lustrous	Start your operation now. I will observe the entire process from outside.	1
