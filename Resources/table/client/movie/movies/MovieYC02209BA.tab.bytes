10	10		301							1	"Beardy"	Is this what we're looking for?	1																					
11	11		301								Kordes	I didn't expect to find it... Seems like there aren't any monsters here. Maybe because we're on such a high floor?	2																					
12	12		301								Zack	Maybe the monsters can't climb stairs. Or maybe we're just lucky.	3																					
13	13		301								Zack	CPFs with earlier serial codes are often prototypes. The government feared a Punishing Virus leak or that the technology wasn't full developed. So they were often built in less populated areas. Looks like it's smaller in scale and the interior hasn't been fully optimized.	3																					
14	14		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Zack	The central control room is the most important place in the tower, so it's relatively easy to find.	3

17	17		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Entering the room, Zack smells a dusty, stale odor, indicating that the room hadn't been opened for quite some time.																						
18	18		301									Zack shows a subtle expression, like a long entangled hatred, but with a flash of memory.																						
19	19		301									His eyes spell a sense of hatred towards something he cannot separate from.																						
20	20		301									Zack touches the console, causing the interface to light up.

26	26		301							1	"Beardy"	You work on that. I'll go see if we can find anything else in the room.		1																				
27	27		202							1					1																			
28	28		301									Zack nods, then begins to study the complex control system.																						
29	29		201							1	500136																							
30	30		301							1	Zack	First, I need to locate the fire door at the entrance... Do I need to input a command...?	1																					
31	31		301								Zack	Damn it. Where the hell am I supposed to find the commands? They were probably set ages ago!	1																					
32	32		301								Zack	Guess I'll see if I can at least open a side door...	1																					
33	33		301								Zack	Wait... the last time this control system was activated... it was during the end of the Post-Pandemic Age?!	1																					
34	34		301								Zack	Since the door to the tower was never opened, why is it still running?! There hasn't been anyone to maintain the centrifuge array. There's no way it should still be in operation!	1																					
35	35		301								Zack	What's going on here... If the tower still functions normally, there shouldn't be so many Hetero-Creatures here!	1																					
36	36		201							2	500140		-600																					
37	37		201							3	500139		600																					
38	38		301							1	Kordes	What's wrong? Your face is pale.	3																					
39	39		301								Zack	Something's... not right with this tower.	1																					
40	40		301								"Beardy"	That's for sure, pal. Look around at all these plants and monsters. Of course, there's something going on here.	2																					
41	41		301								Zack	No, that's not it.	1																					
42	42		301								Zack	I thought this tower was started recently... That's what the operation log states. But the control system shows that it was last activated during the Post-Pandemic Age!	1																					
43	43		301								Zack	So how was the tower activated? Who can bypass the control authentication here and start the tower?	1																					
44	44		301									Zack puts his head in his trembling hands, muttering to himself.																						
45	45		301								Zack	This tower... has been in operation for at least two months.	1																					
46	46		301								"Beardy"	...Something wrong with that?	2																					
47	47		301								Zack	To put it plainly, the CPF is just a super large air conditioner.	1																					
48	48		301								Zack	With the operation of the centrifuge array, the filter tower can separate gases with different densities, allowing it to pull the Punishing Virus from the air and transfer it to the filter element at the base of the tower.	1																					
49	49		301								Zack	Therefore, it's necessary to do routine maintenance on the centrifuge array and clear the filter once it's reached max concentration.	1																					
50	50		301								Zack	Generally, CPFs in areas with larger populations need to have routine maintenance once a month due to the air quality. But even CPFs in forests cannot go two months without maintenance.	1																					
51	51		301								Zack	But... The Punishing concentration here is low, and we can still breathe here safely.	1																					
52	52		301								"Beardy"	Is someone maintaining it?	2																					
53	53		301								Zack	Impossible. It's too complicated. Each step needs to be carried out strictly according to special instructions. Even the slightest error can lead to disastrous results. We can't joke around with the lives of everyone who lives within a 12 kilometer radius.	1																					
54	54		301								"Beardy"	"We"? I get it now. You know, I've been meaning to ask how you know all of this. I know that you're a mechanical engineer, but I didn't know that you used to work in CPFs.	2																					
55	55		301								Zack	"Was" a mechanical engineer.	1																					
56	56		301									Zack quickly corrects him.																						
57	57		301								Zack	I didn't participate in the construction of any tower. I just had to maintain the centrifuge array once since no one wanted to go near it.	1																					
58	58		301								Zack	...After all, it's not easy to maintain it. Any mistake will lead to infection. It's nothing but bad news.	1																					
59	59		301								Zack	The only reward was a nutri-stick. In retrospect, I was just taken advantage of...	1																					
60	60		301								Kordes	If that's the case, where is the filtered Punishing Virus going?	3																					
61	61		301								Zack	That's the problem.	1																					
62	62		301								Kordes	The plants and monsters we saw on the way here...	3																					
63	63		301								Zack	...I don't think things are that simple.	1																					
64	64		301									After Zack presses a few buttons on the terminal, the projection screen suddenly lights up, showing an image.																						
65	65		301									Even "Beardy" who has no knowledge of the CPF can see the seriousness of the situation. The image is covered with red warnings and data.																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				"Beardy"	...What's this?	2

72	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		The image is an indecipherable 3D model. It looks like a heart but also an egg of some kind of creature. Countless red cables stretch out from it, each with a high concentration of Punishing Virus.																						
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The cables look eerily familiar to the Scavengers. They have an uncanny resemblance to the umbilical cords on the humanoid creatures in the forest or the plants in the cracks of the tower.

81	81		301								Zack	The Punishing Virus, which should've been sent to the filter element through the centrifuge array, is being redirected into whatever the hell this thing is.	1																					
82	82		301									Zack clenches his fist on the console even tighter.																						
83	83		301								Kordes	This level of concentration...	3																					
84	84		301									Kordes' voice trembles. He doesn't even dare to look at the alarming data that continues to escalate.																						
85	85		301								"Beardy"	Holy ****. We're done for. Compared to the Red Tide, this is a whole new level.	2																					
86	86		301								"Beardy"	What's this progress bar?	2																					
87	87		301									"Beardy" points to the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. It's visibly ticking up as they watch.																						
88	88		301								"Beardy"	89.6%. What happens when it's full?	2																					
89	89		301									Zack shakes his head in silence.																						
90	90		301									Even if they can't get the answer, they know that when the progress bar is full, nothing good will happen.																						
91	91		301								Zack	What should we do? We can handle one or two Hetero-Creatures, but this looks completely out of our league.	1																					
92	92		301									Should they escape and act like they didn't see anything? The trio exchanges glances, apparently all thinking the same thing.																						
93	93		301								"Beardy"	The existence of something like this is a huge threat. We can't just let it go.	2																					
94	94		301								Zack	Besides, the conservation area we're going to isn't far from here.	1																					
95	95		301								Kordes	...Help.	3																					
96	96		301								Kordes	...Call for help!	3																					
97	97		301								Kordes	This tower was built by the World Government. There must be a communication system, an alarm system, and a special emergency frequency!	3																					
98	98		301								Kordes	If we can send a message, even if it's a radio signal, even if Babylonia's army doesn't receive it, as long as someone can receive it...	3																					
99	99		301								"Beardy"	Someone might come to the rescue! Yeah! Why didn't I think of that...	2																					
100	100		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Zack	I'll give it a try.	1

105	105		301								Roland	They have no idea that we can see all their running, hiding, struggling and even trying to call for help crystal clear on the monitors.	1																					
106	106		301									Looking at the Scavenger with a serious look on the screen, Roland laughs heartily, but his eyes are not smiling at all. Inside them are only deep and complicated emotions.																						
107	107		202							1					1																			
108	108		301									He hears a distant noise in his M.I.N.D., like quietly dusting off an old roll of film and playing it again.

113	113		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland shakes his head, forcing himself to recover from the chaos of noise. The Scavengers' onscreen "performance" continues.																						
114	114		301									They are anxiously checking the large operation panel in the central control room, trying to find a way to contact the ground forces or Babylonia.																						
115	115		301									But the filter's signal had long since been jammed. No one will hear their desperate cries for help.																						
116	116		301									The Scavengers in the image seem to realize this. They stand around the console, their faces pale as a ghost.																						
117	117		301									Roland has seen this look of despair countless times on helpless Constructs and hopeless humans...

123	123		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory425.jpg																								
124	124		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Even for just a moment, Roland still feels the pain tearing his stomach. A feeling of nausea that he had buried in the depths of his soul a long time ago. It was as fleeting as an illusion, but at the moment, it was clear as day.																						
125	125		301									Those feelings that he thought he would not resurface, like ghosts hidden in an abandoned house, begin to haunt him again one by one with the progression of the "performance."																						
126	126		301									â€”These feelings become stronger and stronger until they could no longer be ignored.

131	131		301									Roland smiles with a slight grimace, then jumps off the stack of old machinery and walks to the door.																						
132	132		201							1	500367	1																						
133	133		301							1	Roland	But watching these are dreadfully boring. I'm going to find a place to sleep.	1																					
134	134		301									Before he leaves, he glances back at the rusty schematic of the tower hanging on the wall and the location of hidden fire exits.																						
135	135		301									Generally speaking... the audience isn't allowed on stage.

149	149		301									On the brink of fatigue, "Beardy" drags himself over and grabs Zack's clothes with his trembling hands. He keeps repeating his question. The always cheery smile has disappeared from his face. Instead, there's only the gradual emergence of fear and despair.

164	164		301									As if all his strength has been pulled away, he holds onto the console for support. However, his eyes are transfixed on the bright red color on the projection screen.																						
165	165		301								Zack	Just because of an oversight before I went to sleep... I didn't notice the mechanical abnormality... No, no, that's because I've been lying. Hell, I'm still lying to myself!	1																					
166	166		301								Zack	I said, "How can my machines be infected with an organic virus? Isn't that just a common malfunction?"	1																					
167	167		301								Zack	I hid the mechanical abnormality, and I didn't report it...	1																					
168	168		301								Zack	When I woke up... I opened the door...	1

204	204		301									She immediately looks toward the Hetero-Mother, which was previously in a stable state and is now crying. After the scarlet umbilical cords lost their supply of Punishing Virus, they fall to the ground like a rapidly withering and rotting plant.

223	223		301									Despite all of the Hetero-Creatures they had seen along the way, none frightened them as much as the scene in front of the Scavengers.																						
224	224		301									From the glass wall in front of the central control room, they can see the scene inside the CPF. Only a faint skylight at the top of the tower illuminates the base floor, which had been eroded by the Hetero-Plants.																						
225	225		301									The sturdy, solid vines break open the floor to form a hatch. A huge black shadow appears from deep within the darkness. Something rises gradually on the branches and vines. The sounds of the CPF's walls being scratched and squeezed echo in the nearly fortified space.																						
226	226		301									The dense black shadow is like a giant parasite living in the tower, climbing up among the lingering branches step by step.																						
227	227		201							1	500136																							
228	228		301							1	Zack	Is that it... I didn't expect it to be hiding under the CPF.	1																					
229	229		301								Zack	Is it climbing outside because it can't absorb energy from the centrifuge array?	1																					
230	230		301								Zack	This is only the beginning...	1																					
231	231		301									Zack lowers his head and quickly operates the control terminal. Sweat drips from his forehead and falls on his trembling hands, which does nothing to impede his work.																						
232	232		301								Zack	I need to violate each safety protocol one by one... I never thought I'd see such a day, but...	1																					
233	233		202							1					1																			
234	234		301								Alert	ERROR! ERROR! Centrifuge array in Sector C deactivated. Please contact maintenance personnel to resolve the issue immediately!																						
235	235		301									But who could have thought that doing such a thing would end up helping humanity resist the Punishing Virus?																						
236	236		301									As "Mother" begins to rise, the vines become more aggressive and continue to bang on the door to the central control room. To combat this, Kordes and "Beardy" barricade the door with heavy objects.																						
237	237		301									Both of them slump on the floor with their backs against the heavy objects and look at Zack, who is hurriedly working in front of the console.																						
238	238		301									"Beardy" looks like he has recovered to his usual appearance and smiles bitterly at his empty gun.

240	240		201							3	500139		450																					
241	241		301							1	"Beardy"	Now we really have no way back, Zack.	2																					
242	242		301								Kordes	Hey, "Beardy". Think these flower seeds will grow if I ingest them?	3																					
243	243		301								"Beardy"	Heh... You're always calling me an idiot, but turns out you're the real idiot. I might not know much about plants, but I do know that burying a body under a flower patch burns their roots.	2																					
244	244		301								Kordes	...I just feel sorry that I couldn't make my daughter's wish come true.	3																					
245	245		301								Kordes	But if I die, I just hope I don't see her there.	3																					
246	246		301								Kordes	I hope that she's alive... That she lives to see when dawn of a new day comes.	3																					
247	247		301								"Beardy"	Given how long it's been since you've seen her... If she's still alive, she should be all grown up by now.	2																					
248	248		301									Kordes takes out a photo tightly wrapped in clear plastic from his breast pocket and gently strokes it. In doing so, the small bag of seeds is squeezed out and falls gently onto the floor.																						
249	249		301									But Kordes doesn't pick it up. His eyes remain firmly locked on the photo for a long time.																						
250	250		301									In the yellowing photo, the girl with white hair and pink clothes looks like a gentle flower. She gives the camera a bright smile.																						
251	251		301								Kordes	She's my pride and joy.	3

259	259		201							3	500139		450																					
260	260		301							1	"Beardy"	No point talking about such useless things at a time like this.	2																					
261	261		301								Kordes	We all know that we couldn't have reached the conservation area with the supplies we had.	3																					
262	262		301								Kordes	And obviously, you can't leave us.	3																					
263	263		301								"Beardy"	At least, we'll die fightingâ€”let alone against an entire tower of Hetero-Creatures. This would make for one hell of a movie. We'd be the heroes.	2																					
264	264		301									Even now, "Beardy" tries his best to liven up the mood. Maybe because this is the role he has always played in the team. Or maybe he simply doesn't want his partners' sad expressions to be his last memory as they die together.																						
265	265		301								Kordes	Yeah, you're right. There's even someone to play the role of pulling out his daughter's picture right before he dies. We've got all the roles covered.	3																					
266	266		202							2	3				1																			
267	267		301									Zack chuckles. He lowers his head and swallows the guilt in his eyes as he looks back at the projector screen.																						
268	268		201							1	500136																							
269	269		301							1	Zack	Good. Looks like the centrifuge array in Sector D is also...	1																					
270	270		301								Zack	Rgh...!	1																					
271	271		301									His abdomen feels ice cold at first, followed by intense heat, then agonizing pain.																						
272	272		402							716																								
273	273		401							1	33																							
274	274		301									Zack lowers his head slowly and sees a scarlet branch protruding from his abdomen as blood drips down from it and onto the table.

279	279		202							2	3				1																			
280	280		301									All this happens so suddenly that no one had noticed branches emerging from the small vents in the ceiling.																						
281	281		301									Due to the intense pain from the stab wound in his abdomen, Zack can no longer support himself and falls to the ground slowly.																						
282	282		301									The wound quickly shows symptoms of Punishing infection. A burning sensation rapidly spreads to his limbs.																						
283	283		201							2	500140		-450																					
284	284		201							3	500139		450

286	286		301								Kordes	Here!	3																					
287	287		301									Kordes hurriedly takes out the box of serum from his bag, grabs a vial, and prepares to give Zack an injection.																						
288	288		202							2	3				1																			
289	289		201							1	500136																							
290	290		301							1	Zack	D-don't... It's... no use... Don't w-waste it...	1																					
291	291		301									Zack reaches out and stops Kordes' hand holding the serum, shaking his head.

298	298		301							1	Zack	I've... had it coming...	1																					
299	299		301									He struggles to raise his head and looks at the progress bar on the projection screen.																						
300	300		301									â€”79.9%																						
301	301		301								Zack	...Is t-that it?	1																					
302	302		202							1					1																			
303	303		301									Through the glass, the giant indescribable shell rises up to the height of the central control room. It appears this is the highest it can reach. The black armored shell tightly wraps the soft red underbelly. It frantically shakes the umbilical cords connected to it, screaming in agony.																						
304	304		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	â€”!																						
305	305		301									A moment later, the barricaded door is smashed open by some immense force from outside.																						
306	306		301									Outside, they see a pale girl floating.																						
307	307		301									Or rather, being hoisted in the air. Two fish-shaped Hetero-Creatures tightly holding strands of cloth hanging from her clothes give her the illusion of floating.																						
308	308		301									A half-broken wing stretches out from behind her. The girl's golden pupils are like a bottomless haze devoid of emotion.																						
309	309		201							1	500308																							
310	310		301							1	Cinderelik	Please stop hurting "Mother".	1																					
311	311		301								Cinderelik	Please stop interfering with the tower.	1																					
312	312		301									The girl raises her slender wrist and points to the huge shell hanging in the distance.																						
313	313		301								Cinderelik	"Mother" is about to go through the most crucial stage. I can't let her be in danger at this time.	1																					
314	314		301								Cinderelik	You should have come to help incubate "Mother".	1																					
315	315		301								Cinderelik	...Instead, you hurt it.	1																					
316	316		301								Cinderelik	This is an unforgivable sin.	1																					
317	317		301									With her light, gentle tone, the pale and thin girl looks vulnerable, but the Scavengers knew the moment the door was torn open that she is no ordinary human nor is she on their side.																						
318	318		301								Cinderelik	Now, please, turn into a bouquet of red flowers for "Mother".	1																					
319	319		301									She delivers them the most cruel death sentence in her most gentle tone.																						
320	320		401							2	10007502																							
321	321		301			RImgBg1Shake						Right as Cinderelik points her finger at the Scavengers, a giant hole is blown out of the wall beside her with a sudden bang. Scrap metal and cement fly past her. In response, she quickly commands her fish, allowing her to escape unharmed. However, the sudden blast interrupts her attack.																						
322	322		201							1	500384																							
323	323		301							1	???	Oops! Sorry! My aim was a little off. I didn't hurt you, did I? Looks my aim has suffered from being so weak right now.	1																					
324	324		202							1					1																			
325	325		301									A figure appears in the breached wall. He shakes the chain blade in his hand, and the dust from the explosion slowly settles.																						
326	326		201							1	500308																							
327	327		301							1	Cinderelik	Roland?	1																					
328	328		301								Cinderelik	...I'm fine. Please be more careful next time.	1

330	330		201							2	500367	1	450																					
331	331		301							1		The figure emerges from the dust. Shaking the dust off his hair, he smiles gracefully.																						
332	332		301								Roland	Good. I didn't miss the climax, did I?	2																					
333	333		301								Cinderelik	They hurt "Mother" and hindered der Meister's plan. They have to pay the price.	1																					
334	334		301								Roland	Heh... Looks like they're already scared out of their wits.	2																					
335	335		301								Roland	Think I can have a word with them?	2																					
336	336		202							1	2				1																			
337	337		301									Cinderelik silently floats to the side and lands in the corner of the room.

339	339		301							1	Roland	Thank you so much.	1																					
340	340		301									Roland looks at the Scavengers with a smile.																						
341	341		301								Roland	Hmph, what a pity. Especially you, Zack... That wound sure looks serious. I'd advise you to leave him behind. You can't escape with him.	1																					
342	342		201							1	500136																							
343	343		301							1	Zack	Aren't you... Rolmo...?	1																					
344	344		201							1	500367	1																						
345	345		301							1	Roland	Ah, I'm surprised you recognize me even as you're about to go unconscious. I'm touched.	1																					
346	346		201							1	500136																							
347	347		301							1	Zack	I-I was suspicious of you... ever since we entered the t-tower... Cough...	1

352	352		301								Kordes	Why'd you trick us...	3																					
353	353		202							2	3				1																			
354	354		301									The Scavengers' surprise in realizing that they were deceived was just as Roland had imagined, but their reaction lacks in intensity. Probably because they were already past the point of exhaustion.																						
355	355		201							1	500367	1																						
356	356		301							1	Roland	I didn't trick you.	1																					
357	357		301								Roland	The forest... The tower... The supplies... Every word I said was the truth. You saw it with your own eyes.	1																					
358	358		301								Roland	I gave you intel and warned you about the intel. But, it was ultimately you who made the decision to come here, didn't you?	1																					
359	359		204							1																								
360	360		301								Roland	So far, everything was on your own volition. I just led the way.	1																					
361	361		301									Roland's smile disappears from the corner of his lips. His tone carries a sense of pity. A trace of inexplicable sadness flashes in his eyes as he looks at them.																						
362	362		301									Maybe this is just another layer of his act.

376	376		301							1	Roland	Right, my apologies. What I said wasn't forthright enough.	1																					
377	377		301									Roland reaches out and gestures with a finger toward "Beardy" and Kordes.																						
378	378		301								Roland	You... And You... If you leave Zack here, I'll ensure your safe departure from this place. How does that sound?	1
