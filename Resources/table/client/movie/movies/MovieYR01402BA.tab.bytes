10	10		301								Nikola	Besides, you're setting off to support the alliance ship route. Take the chance to get more familiar with your new frame.	2

13	13		301								Nikola	Is it because they owe the Forest Guard a favor due to the previous battle? Even if I don't accept, you'll probably find a way to return, right?	2

16	16		301								Nikola	So this is the best solution. But remember, I will only provide limited support.	2
