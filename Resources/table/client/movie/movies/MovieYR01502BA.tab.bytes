13	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Rolling billows of smoke are the first to appear. Flames pierce the pale sky, and a subtle burning smell fills the ruins.																						
14	13		301									â€”People know better than to guess at what is emitting the foul odor.																						
15	14		301									Fires burn intermittently throughout the ruins, followed by the sounds of two heavy objects crashing onto the ground.																						
16	15		301									The firelight and the sounds of falling cut through the long confrontation, but they do nothing to restore this war-torn city to normal.																						
17	16		301									Among the ruins, a figure is walking through the fires of war.																						
18	17		301									She climbs over a destroyed wall, through a fallen cement pipe, and turns over an inconspicuous slab of cement.																						
19	18		301									â€”Only to see four gun barrels pointed at her.

29	28		301								Pulao Crew	The commander of the East Wall Defense Line suggests that you fall back three blocks, and then blast the buildings to fall back!	1																					
30	29		301								Qu	What about the commander?	2																					
31	30		301								Pulao Crew	The commander only had me tell you: "Thank you for not killing me eight years ago."	1																					
32	31		301								Qu	...So he's trying to die on the battlefield after all.	2

43	42		301								Qu	The defense line extends from the Alpha Line to the Iota Lina. Some nodes must have held their positions.	2																					
44	43		301								Qu	They need someone to hold the frontline to give them time to retreat.	2																					
45	44		301								Guard	But!
