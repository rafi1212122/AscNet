13	13		301							1	Construct Soldier	One more thing. Our squad had to abandon some weapon supplies when we engaged with the Corrupted just now. There are Levi-Gun core components in there.	2																					
14	14		301								Construct Soldier	If you can secure them, then that Support-type Construct over there should be able to hop back into action.	2

56	56		301								Lee	What I mean is that, I had a feeling you'd do something like this someday, so I've made config presets of different limb models for you.	3
