28	25		301							1	Lee	Even if the Corrupted here are stronger than those outside, they should still be susceptible to damage.	1																					
29	26		301								Liv	There are... strange devices inside these Corrupted...	2																					
30	27		301								Lee	That's... the core modules of Iso-Devices...	1

33	30		301							1	Lucia	So you mean, they gained new abilities by corrupting the Iso-Devices?	1																					
34	31		201							1	1011001																							
35	32		301							1	Lee	This is severe. Iso-Device corruption... HQ didn't mention any of this.	1																					
36	33		301								Lee	So that's why the Iso-Devices were sealed off before we arrived.	1																					
37	34		201							1	1031001

45	42		301								Lee	You again?	1																					
46	43		301								Vera	Just a kind little reminder—	2																					
47	44		301								Vera	There are several... tricky folks heading toward your way.	2																					
48	45		301								Lee	What a timely reminder—those "tricky folks" are already right here.	1																					
49	46		301								Vera	So you don't need a little tip then?	2																					
50	47		301								Lee	...	1																					
51	48		301								Vera	Hmph. Their shields can be neutralized by the Iso-Devices. If you want to destroy them, you'll need to do it within the Iso-Device fields.	2																					
52	49		301								Lee	Stop with the act. You left them for us intentionally.	1																					
53	50		301								Vera	Oh my... You caught me. After all, dealing with these things would slow us down tremendously.	2																					
54	51		301								Vera	Well then, give it your best! I'll be seeing you!	2																					
55	52		301								Lee	Hold on. Don't you have anything else to add?	1																					
56	53		301								Vera	Hmph. Since when did you become so fussy... That won't make you very popular with the ladies.	2																					
57	54		301								Lee	Sorry, but that's none of your concern.	1																					
58	55		301								Vera	Al-right, I'll give you a little something in return. A "wish ticket" from Cerberus whenever you need help or something.	2																					
59	56		301								Lee	Don't even try this. Don't expect us to clean up your mess for an empty promise.	1																					
60	57		301								Lee	I was naive to even think that you'd feel apologetic for anything—your actions are going in the mission report.	1																					
61	58		301								Vera	Aha, that's even less trouble for us—Tifa's getting a little bit out of hand and just slipped through our fingers, so I'll have to go. I'll miss chatting with you, dear. So lo-ong.	2
