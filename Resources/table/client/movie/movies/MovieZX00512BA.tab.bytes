6	6		301								Lucia	So this is what Liv's M.I.N.D. looks like...	2																					
7	7		301								Lee	To be exact, it's the M.I.N.D. once placed in a central memory vessel.	3

16	16		301								Lucia	What do you mean?	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	She's with those embodiments of the Punishing Virus.	3																					
18	18		301								Lucia	You mean, she's corrupted?	2																					
19	19		301								Lee	Corruption status would directly reflect in the environments of the M.I.N.D.	3																					
20	20		301								Lee	From what we can tell here, the corruption should still be far below Liv's barrier threshold.	3																					
21	21		301								Lee	I think... Liv might have lost in the battle with the central container and became imprisoned within it.	3																					
22	22		301								Lucia	So, this isn't really Liv, but a pseudo-consciousness of her?	2																					
23	23		301								Lee	Yes. If we eliminate this pseudo-consciousness, Liv should have a chance to return.	3
