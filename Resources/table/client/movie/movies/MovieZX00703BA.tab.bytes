8	8		301							1	Liv	The ruins here are convoluted. Plus, a large amount of Corrupted are wandering around. We should consider other plans to advance.	3																					
9	9		301								Liv	So as to avoid the situation just now. If the commandant was drawn in by that...	3

15	15		301								Karenina	No, I need to get this out! If they weren't being slowpokes, we wouldn't have been sealed off!	2																					
16	16		301								Karenina	And it's not like the Gray Ravens would get into any trouble even if our mission failed!	2

31	31		302								He found his target?	32																						
32	32		301								Bianca	From our current available information, likely.	1

44	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Karenina lowers herself and sits on a nearby rock. Bianca does so too and sits by her side.																						
45	45		301									The rippling sand swims through the air, further lowering the visibility of the ruins.																						
46	46		301									Broken arrows and tools with a metallic sheen lay haphazardly above the dunes, as if hurriedly abandoned by someone.																						
47	47		301									Even without a Corrupted in sight, it was not silence and relief that befell, but instead the blare of the digging devices.																						
48	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Liv carefully navigates past the high-disruption machines, and continues the scanning and processing of the environment.

59	59		301							1	Liv	The ruins here are all structurally connected. But due to the drilling device, many areas have already collapsed and are inaccessible.	3																					
60	60		301								Liv	In turn, however, we can take advantage of how the drill operates and follow the underground route it created through the hole on the surface, circling back to near where we were.	3																					
61	61		301								Liv	This is going to cost us more time.	3																					
62	62		301								Lucia	Will there be any risk?	2																					
63	63		301								Liv	Since none of the ruins are secured... all we can do is try our best to avoid areas that have collapsed or are heavily weathered to minimize the risks.	3																					
64	64		302								I'll be fine. Don't worry.	65
