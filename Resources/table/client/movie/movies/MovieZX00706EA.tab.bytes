20	20		301								Bianca	Which is why I have to go first. The Purifying Force excels at pursuits—I'll save much more time travelling by myself.	2																					
21	21		301								Bianca	No one can guarantee how stable Kamui is at this point. If he's indeed down this path, I cannot let Karen take on him alone.	2
