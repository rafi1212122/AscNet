6	8		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	From the radar readings and Changyu's description, this should be the port Commandant's signals came from.	3																					
7	9		301								Lee	We can't get a more precise set of coordinates. Our radars are not only being interfered with, but Commandant's signal is being blocked and double-encrypted.	3																					
8	10		301								Lee	Asslam just took heavy damage and their combative capability is limited. Sophia and Changyu both expressed wishes to join in our rescue of Commandant, but it might not be appropriate.	3																					
9	11		301								Lucia	Yes, we'll have to find Commandant by ourselves.	1																					
10	12		301								Lee	Changyu's suggestion is that we wait here for... that legendary "ship".	3																					
11	13		301								Lucia	Let's do another ground search. We might have missed something. Commandant...	1																					
12	14		301								Lucia	...I just lost the connection to Commandant.	1																					
13	15		301								Lee	Same here.	3																					
14	16		301								Liv	...Commandant.	2																					
15	17		301								Lee	Calm your M.I.N.D. The signal didn't die off suddenly, so Commandant must have disconnected it on purpose. No harm should have come to Commandant.	3																					
16	18		301								Liv	But what would make Commandant disconnect on us like that?	2																					
17	19		301								Lucia	We'll have to trust Commandant.	1																					
18	20		301								Lee	After all, 【kuroname】 is not someone who gives up without a fight. Commandant must be trying to get back to us.	3

36	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lucia	The sounds seem to be rhythmic. Is that some kind of song?	1																					
37	36		301								Lee	Or it might be a form of "opera recital."	3																					
38	37		301								Liv	Opera recital?	2																					
39	38		301								Lee	I looked it up through speech detection, but I found nothing except some pre-pandemic text about "Xiqu", a form of opera. The lines are apparently saying something about puppet shows.	3																					
40	39		301								Lee	The writing is archaic and rhetorical, and seems be from some lost Eastern civilization. This would be classified as part of the precious human legacy.	3																					
41	40		301								Lee	...Well, hard to get more info than this right now, though.	3																					
42	41		301								Liv	I feel like Ayla would be overjoyed if she's here.	2																					
43	42		301								Lucia	The ship has docked.	1																					
44	43		301								Liv	I detect the presence of Commandant's Mind Beacon...	2																					
45	44		301								Lee	Right on this ship.	3																					
46	45		301								Lucia	(Nods)	1																					
47	46		301								Liv	...A lot of biological signals coming from the ship. No Corrupted signals yet...	2
