8	8		301								Coordinating Officer	The supply line needs to be flexible. Every squad will have a Support Force agent acting as a go-between. Any more questions?	1

19	19		301									As time passes, more and more Construct squads land in the area in response to President Hassen's call to arms. Meanwhile, all sorts of combat facilities are being set up near the port.																						
20	20		301									Though battle-hardened, none have been in a war of such a scale. A mix of nervousness and excitement quickens everyone's steps.

22	22		301							1	Lee	We're up against not regular Corrupted or just one Ascendant, but a well-disciplined army. We would stand a better chance if Kowloong agreed to ally with us.	1

29	29		301							1	Lucia	The area behind us is covered with field operation facilities, and so is unlikely to become a battlefield. Still, there's no telling what will happen.	1																					
30	30		301								Yazi	...But this is our home. We should be the ones fighting at the front lines.	2																					
31	31		302								The rear lines matter as much as the front lines.	32	You don't trust us?	33																				
32	32	34	301								Yazi	...Thank you. If that's the case, then we shall follow it. You can count on us to keep the rear safe.	2																					
33	33		301								Yazi	Of course I trust you... We'll do our best to defend the rear.	2

37	37		302								Understood.	9938	What's the situation now?	9939																				
38	9938	40	301								Coordinating Officer	Thank you. Elite squad indeed. Very cooperative.	1																					
39	9939		301								Coordinating Officer	All the squads are in position. Now all we need to do is to build as many defense facilities as possible before the enemy gets here.	1

42	42		301							1	Lee	Do you think we stand a chance?	2																					
43	43		301								Coordinating Officer	I think we do, otherwise the president wouldn't have summoned all of us here. Plus, Kowloong seems to still be hiding a lot of Constructs. We should have the upper hand against the Corrupted.	1

85	84		302								Okay.	85	Why?	86																				
86	85	87	301								Liv	Thank you. Lucia, Lee, can you do that too and line our hands up together?	1
