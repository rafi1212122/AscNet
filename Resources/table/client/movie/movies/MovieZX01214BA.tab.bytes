6	6		301									"In position," as in near the light wall. Luna did not spell it out loud, but the three Ascendants are fully aware that certain results are expected in this operation.																						
7	7		301									As the war rages on in Kowloong, the balance slowly shifts. The Ascendants have occupied quite a few outer areas and turned them into domains of the virus.

15	15		301									Lamia compresses the virus and discharges it wherever she goes. Just like what Roland said, the Phecda—without Inver-Devices to protect them—are easy hosts for the virus. They quickly join the Corrupted ranks.

17	17		301							1	Phecda Leader	Damn it...	1																					
18	18		202							1																								
19	19		301									As the viral density in the area rises, Kowloong's arrogance gives way to angst. They begin to lock down streets to minimize the damage.

22	22		301							1	Phecda A	Captain, there's a female Corrupted at the defense line!	1																					
23	23		301								Phecda Leader	From the way she moves... she's an Ascendant! All units, destroy her!	2																					
24	24		202							1	2																							
25	25		301									At the Phecda leader's command, all Phecdas snap into action and fire away at Lamia. But instead of hitting the target—																						
26	26		301									The bullets phase right through her.																						
27	27		201							1	500170																							
28	28		301							1	Phecda Leader	Is that only a... projected image? Then she must be near. Smoke her out!	1																					
29	29		201							1	500165																							
30	30		301							1	Lamia	No, not a projection, but an illusion. It's bye-bye when you see it.	1

32	32		301							1	Phecda Leader	Ugh... Aaargh!	1																					
33	33		202							1																								
34	34		301									Before the Kowloong guards can scatter, Lamia descends upon them. With a point of her finger, bulges appear on their bodies and quickly spread over like rashes.																						
35	35		301									A Lamia specialty—using the Punishing Virus to paralyze a frame's control systems.																						
36	36		301									The virus spreads amid anguished cries, but Lamia does not seem the least bothered by the screams. Instead, a stricken expression overtakes her.																						
37	37		201							1	500165																							
38	38		301							1	Lamia	This is exhausting... Those explosions too, it must have been Gabriel... Looks like he can handle that light wall himself...	1																					
39	39		301								Lamia	And Roland...	1																					
40	40		301								Lamia	Oh, no response...? Maybe... I can just... go home first...?	1																					
41	41		301								Lamia	...Naw, that won't do. They'll be mad...	1																					
42	42		301								Lamia	Someone's coming this way along the train tracks... Must be that Akdilek they mentioned earlier... How did Babylonia manage to bring all these people together?	1																					
43	43		202							1																								
44	100		301									As Lamia ruminates on her growing troubles, her expression darkens. Eventually, she lets out a resigned sigh.																						
45	44		201							1	500165	8																						
46	45		301							1	Lamia	...Fiiineee. I'll go somewhere populated in the city and start putting on a show. That should please Miss Luna.	1																					
47	46		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lamia	Mh-hm, sounds like a plan.	1
