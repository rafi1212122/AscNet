4	3		301			DialogEnable						You run upstairs like Lee told you to, carrying the signal transmitter Ayla gave you. Finally, you reach the top of the Observatory.																						
5	4		301									What greets you is a heavenly dome dotted with stars. At your feet is a grass field, and around you are purplish-red flowers. The current war seems to have left this place untouched.																						
6	5		301			RImgBg1Shake						And then, you find yourself flying. Caught completely unaware, you were sent crashing into a railing.

9	557		201							1	500150																							
10	7		301							1	Qu	Hah... Your escape ends here, commandant of Gray Raven.	1																					
11	8		302								My team members...	9	You caught up...	10																				
12	9	11	301								Qu	Still resisting, but not for long.	1																					
13	10	11	301								Qu	No. I didn't catch up—You, finally arrived. This will be your parting gift.	1																					
14	558		401							2	1516																							
15	11		301									Qu falls silent and marches toward you. The light glimmering off her blade almost blinds you, and the pain from the previous blow renders your temporarily incapacitated.																						
16	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Qu lifts her blade.

19	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Qu	This is it. Become history, commandant of Babylonia!

24	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Someone descends from the air and interrupts Qu.

26	500		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab	2																							
27	16		301									She drives Qu backward with one cut—followed by others, relentlessly. Each swing sends forth cold particles, coating the nearby plants with rime.

33	18		301				DialogDisable			1		Black. Red. Your rescuer is a most familiar, yet also a most strange figure. She perks up upon noticing your unease.																						
34	223		201						2000	1	500166	1																						
35	19		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	Are you okay, Commandant?	1																					
36	700		302								I'm fine.	20	Lucia?	21																				
37	20	22	301								Lucia	Nothing makes me happier hearing that, Commandant.	1																					
38	21	22	301								Lucia	Yes. Lucia, your Lucia, Commandant.	1																					
39	22		301								Lucia	Can you stand, Commandant? I'm a bit tied up right now...	1																					
40	300		202							1																								
41	301		401							2	10002001																							
42	23		301							1		Qu slightly regains her posture, and goes on the offense. Lucia, too, braces for it with her dual blades. Despite their apparent resemblance, Lucia's combat style makes it clear that it is a frame different from Lotus.																						
43	24		301			RImgBg1Shake						Lucia punctuates her attacks with airborne moves. Qu is overpowered, until she finally manages to gain distance by pushing Lucia out of range with a sweep of her blade.																						
44	227		201							1	500166	1																						
45	25		301							1	Lucia	Oh, I haven't introduced you to my new frame yet. I came up with a name for it on my way over: Plume. Do you like it?	1																					
46	26		301									Lucia speaks about her new frame as she adjusts her posture. The introduction, however, is tinged with a strange hint of sadness on her face.																						
47	228		204							1	4																							
48	27		301									She sheathes her ice-borne blade behind, then draws her two-handed blade for an upward slash at Qu.

52	28		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	Qu	Huaxu, what on earth is this Construct?	2																					
53	1004		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab																							
54	6001		401							2	10002001																							
55	29		301								Huaxu	Construct ID is BPL-01. Consciousness name, Lucia.																						
56	30		301								Qu	That's not what I need from you!	2																					
57	31		301								Huaxu	To adapt to her frame, she is still currently initializing her M.I.N.D.																						
58	32		301								Qu	What?!	2																					
59	33		301									Their weapons meet, equal in strength. But with the help of the boosters on her back, Lucia gains an upper hand in this contest of strength, breaking Qu's glaive.																						
60	1003		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab	3																							
61	1006		401							2	10002001																							
62	34		301			PanelActor2Shake						Qu is forced to go on the defensive to dodge Lucia's attacks.																						
63	1007		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab																							
64	306		202							2																								
65	35		301									She conjures a new weapon out of the virus with her other hand and throws it at you. Almost instantaneously, Lucia tosses her blade to deflect the projectile, protecting you once more.																						
66	2301		201							1	500166																							
67	36		301							1	Lucia	Don't even think about it.	1																					
68	999		302								What's that about you initializing your M.I.N.D.?	1000	Lucia, your memories...	1002																				
69	1000	37	204							1	1																							
70	37	38	301								Lucia	A factory reset, essentially. Do you still remember the first time we met, Commandant?	1																					
71	38	40	301								Lucia	I was like a puppet back then...	1																					
72	1002	39	204							1	1																							
73	39	40	301								Lucia	Most of it is gone. Only combat-related ones are left.	1																					
74	40		301								Lucia	I know what you're trying to ask, Commandant. It's the only way for me to use this frame.	1																					
75	1100		201							2	500150		400																					
76	1101		203							1		-400																						
77	41		301								Qu	You maniac... You're killing yourself, just to use this frame?	2																					
78	229		204							1	5																							
79	42		301								Lucia	I'm not killing myself. I'm becoming a new me.	1																					
80	43		301								Qu	That is merely a game of words. Does this world hold something of such value, that you would even give your soul for it?	2																					
81	44		301								Lucia	Of course it does... You wouldn't understand!	1																					
82	45		301								Qu	Hark! I give you death not out of caprice!	2																					
83	46		301								Qu	Ever since the outbreak, we, Kowloong, foresaw the fate of Earth! We toiled for the Tabula Akasha—our only true purpose!	2																					
84	47		301								Qu	If you have something you wish to protect, then you would know that beauty only lives in the past!	2																					
85	48		301								Lucia	You're just afraid of facing the future!	1																					
86	49		301			RImgBg1Shake						The two resume fighting. Their blades clash—slide off—lacerate each other. No longer is there a need for dodging attacks, only receiving the opponent in full.																						
87	50		301								Qu	Earth's fate is decided. I will destroy you both, and I will put history to rest!	2																					
88	51		301								Lucia	And how would you do that...?	1																					
89	52		301								Qu	Gestalt, the thing that spawned this era and has kept it alive to this day. With an AI system of similar make, I can take over the entire Babylonia.	2																					
90	53		301								Qu	And it shall fall. With the planetary mass of Babylonia, Earth will enter into an ice age when it plummets to the surface.	2																					
91	54		301								Qu	Then, no longer will there be a place for us in the entire universe. Huaxu will destroy what is left of humanity. Kowloong will be all that is left.	2																					
92	55		301								Qu	And Earth will become a tablet of all that was human—the Tabula Akasha.	2																					
93	8523		302								I will never let that happen!	56	Gestalt is not a tool to destroy the world.	57																				
94	56	58	301								Qu	You think you, a mere human, can stop me?	2																					
95	57	58	301								Qu	The wielder makes the tool! Not the tool the wielder!	2																					
96	241		204							1	1																							
97	58		301								Lucia	Let's stop her together, Commandant!	1																					
98	59		301									Lucia raises her blade. The motion reminds you of the first time you met her; fearless, as always, yet now embellished with a hint of warmth.																						
99	60		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And yet...
