3	4		301			DialogEnable						—It's over.																						
4	5		301									You don't know which one of you said that first, but it's over.																						
5	6		301									The whole city lies in shambles, with buildings wrecked and roads clustered with debris. To make matters worse, the spread of the Punishing Virus has sealed off even more of Kowloong.																						
6	7		301									The Ascendants are gone. The rebuilt defense lines are keeping the Corrupted at bay. Soon the city will return to peace—or at least, that is what everyone believes.																						
7	8		301									Relieved, some teams let themselves collapse to the ground, enjoying this moment of respite.

9	9		301							1	Guard	...	1																					
10	10		301									The Kowloongers no longer bother with removing the outsiders, nor do they give thanks. They merely give them cursory glances before returning to their designated positions, unspoken words in their voice modules.

12	11		301									Some distance away, the reinforcing factions, who played key roles in turning the tide of this battle, are resting. Despite the victory, not a trace of joy decorates their faces.																						
13	12		301									A liaison officer scurries over with panic on his face. He seems to have something important to say.

15	13		301							1	Lee	It's about Gestalt, right Commandant...?	1																					
16	14		301									Lucia has been asleep since the battle ended. Ayla and Liv take her and retreat to the rear. You and Lee are alone in a yard some distance away from the crowd.																						
17	113		302								Yes.	15	What will happen to Lucia?	16																				
18	15	17	301								Lee	I could've probably stopped Gabriel if I had moved faster.	1																					
19	16	17	301								Lee	And then... she will become another Lucia, right?	1																					
20	17		301									The sky is clearing, but this place remains shrouded in gloom.																						
21	18		301								Lee	The virus just popped out of a Zero-Point Engine and destroyed everything on Earth.	1																					
22	19		301								Lee	The virus twisted our minds and made us like this.	1																					
23	20		301								Lee	Everyone has sacrificed a lot. First the Kowloong people, and now... Lucia.	1																					
24	21		301								Lee	What is it that the virus really wants?	1																					
25	114		302								I don't know.	22	Probably destroy us.	23																				
26	22	24	301								Lee	Yeah. It's just a guess, but I think even the Ascendants are clueless about what the virus wants.	1																					
27	23	24	301								Lee	Quite like the demon king in the story.	1																					
28	24		301									With that, Lee raises his hand to block the morning sun.	1																					
29	25		301								Lee	We will continue to fight the Punishing Virus tomorrow and the days after, right?	1																					
30	1115		302								That's right.	26	And we WILL win.	26																				
31	26		301								Lee	Mm.	1																					
32	27		301								Lee	Go back, Commandant.	1

34	28		301									Ahead of you is a path into the unknown, behind you is an endless trail of destruction.																						
35	41		301									But no one is backing down, because reality doesn't allow them to.																						
36	42		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This is... what the world has become.
