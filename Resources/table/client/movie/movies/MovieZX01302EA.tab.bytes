10	258523		301								Cathy 6337	They are, few. Bad colleagues, recently, occasionally appear.																						
11	258524		301								Cathy 6337	An open air theme parkâ€”quiet, lively, choice for relaxation!

15	11		302								So those were just a few strays, huh?	12

19	15		301							1	Liv	I looked up the records of other Golden Age theme parks, and they don't seem to use that many mechanoids. So that might have just been a coincidence...	2

22	18		301							1	Ayla	Probably because a theme park is meant to accommodate tourists, right?	1																					
23	19		301								Ayla	You only need enough mechanoids to satisfy the needs of human tourists. So you don't need a lot of 'em.	1																					
24	20		302								Ayla? You're here too!	21																						
25	21		301								Ayla	Of course! I happened to be in a base nearby, so I applied to President Hassen to come over!	1																					
26	22		301								Ayla	We recovered some pretty interesting relics from the operation in Kowloong, so Allen's interest for Earth has been growingâ€”	1																					
27	23		301								Ayla	Anyway, I'm just here to play and have fun!	1

34	29		302								Is Babylonia okay...	30	Everyone's here...	31																				
35	30	33	301								Sophia	...? Babylonia is okay.	1																					
36	31		301								Sophia	Celica said, "Next vacation might be in who-knows-how-long, so I might as well get everyone in on this."	1																					
37	32		301								Sophia	That's what she said.	1

43	38		301								Karenina	I heard about your vacation from ã€kuronameã€‘, and I sped it through with the Prez. Karenina, now here in the name of "reconstruction inspection"!	1																					
44	39		301									Karenina stands with her hands planted on her hips, glaring all over. She seems to be searching for someone.																						
45	40		301								Karenina	...Where's Lucia? Don't think you can hide from me by going on some vacation! We'll settle this once and for all this time!	1																					
46	999005		201							1	1031001

48	999007		201							1	500196																							
49	999008		301							1	Karenina	I hopped over straight from the work site. No time to switch outta this specialized frame.	1																					
50	42		201							1	500166																							
51	43		301							1	Lucia	I didn't come on vacation to avoid you. I received a mission telling us to "wind down."	1																					
52	52365		201							1	500196																							
53	59595		301							1	Karenina	I see... So it's a contest of who winds down the best, huh? Alright then!	1																					
54	59596		301								Karenina	Whatever it is, and whatever reason you give. You're not getting away this time!	1																					
55	59597		301								Karenina	Lucia is Lucia! Even if her memory data's gone all wonky, she's still the same Lucia I'm gonna beat!	1

60	47		301								Ayla	We gotta have fun and play in a water park, right? So... how do we do that?	1																					
61	48		302								...We eat and drink, maybe?	50	...We walk around, maybe?	58

66	54		301							1	Liv	Well, our sensory receptors can experience taste too.	1																					
67	55		201							1	500166																							
68	56		301							1	Lucia	But it is not accompanied by the human feeling of satiety and pleasure.	1																					
69	57	60	301								Lucia	...Well, it's still worth exploring this place, I think.	1																					
70	58		201							1	500166	1																						
71	59		301							1	Lucia	...Yeah, this place does seem worthy of exploration.	1
