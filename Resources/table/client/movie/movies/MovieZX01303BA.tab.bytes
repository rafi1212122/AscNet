12	12		301									The giant building behind encircles the beach and the sea. A silence takes over.																						
13	13		301									The slightly salty sea breeze blows the whimsical waves at you, causing droplets to fizzle on your face. It reminds you that this is not a holo-movie in Babylonia, but a place that physically exists.																						
14	14		301									And the fine sand beneath your feet too, seeps slowly into your tactical boots from your weight, scratching your instep.

18	18		302								Yeah.	19																						
19	19		301								Liv	The beach and the sea breeze... It does make one want to wind down...	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	Yawn...	2																					
21	21		301								Lucia	Hnnh, why... do I feel kinda sleepy?	2																					
22	22		302								Constructs can feel sleepy?	257																						
23	257		301								Lucia	Hm... Probably an automatic response of our human-simulation modules... Commandant, can you help me turn it off?	2																					
24	23		301								Liv	It's a vacation, though, Lucia. Don't you plan on relaxing a little?	1

55	54		301									How much time has passed before today...?																						
56	55		301									You feel like you have been battling for a long, long time.																						
57	56		301									At that thought, you cannot help but look to the side...																						
58	57		301									...And see Kamui trying to use his Big Kamui as a... surfboard?!																						
59	58		301									Chrome is trying to stop Kamui from doing so, but to little success.																						
60	59		301									...And look at Kamui now all drenched. No way Big Kamui can float.

73	70		301									You hear sand shufflingâ€”likely Lucia and Liv sitting down beside you.																						
74	71		301								Lucia	Commandant.	1																					
75	72		302								Yes?	73																						
76	73		301								Lucia	If there comes a day, when the battle against the virus is finally over...	1																					
77	74		301								Lucia	What will become of you, and us?	1																					
78	75		302								There might be new battles to be fought, still.	76	I guess we'll all return to our daily lives.	83																				
79	76		204							1	4																							
80	77		301								Lucia	New battles, huh...	1																					
81	78		301								Liv	That honestly makes me a bit mixed up.	2																					
82	79		301								Lucia	But no matter where we are, or who we serve...	1																					
83	80		301								Lucia	I am forever your blade, and this will never change.	1																					
84	81		301								Liv	And we fight... so that there will come a day where no one has to anymore.	2																					
85	82	300	301								Liv	So Commandant, if the day comes when you don't have to battle anymore... How would you like to live? I think Ayla mentioned that you have potential as an artist.	2																					
86	83		204							1	6																							
87	84		301								Lucia	Will there finally be peace...? I surely hope so.	1																					
88	85		301								Liv	When the virus is gone, along with the threat of the Corrupted...	2																					
89	86		301								Liv	The things mentioned in the database about the Golden Age... Shopping malls, summer breaks, social networksâ€”they will all come back, right?	2																					
90	87		301								Lucia	...How would you like to live, then, Commandant?	1																					
91	88		301								Lucia	Would you like to study? Or work? If Ayla is right, you might have the potential to be an artist too!	1																					
92	89		302								What do you think, Lucia?	85256	What do you think, Liv?	44458

103	94		301								Liv	I've read that people had to paint in order to capture special moments before holograms and sensory simulations were invented.	2																					
104	95	96	301								Liv	If these paintings were done by Commandant... I'd be looking forward to seeing what they depict.	2

106	8584		203							2	0.25																							
107	96		301							1	Liv	Speaking of, we never really had the opportunity to think about our "future," didn't we?	2

109	52558		201							2	500166																							
110	96325		301							1	Lucia	No, we didn't. I wonder... what will our future look like?	2																					
111	25875		202							1	2	3			1																			
112	97		301									The... future?																						
113	98		301									You have no idea.																						
114	99		301									At least, your teachers from F.O.S. could not give you any answers about the future.																						
115	100		301									It has taken so long and so many sacrifices for Babylonia to have a chance to fight back the insurmountable odds.																						
116	101		301									To obtain the ultimate victory, Babylonia itself and everyoneâ€”this generation and beyondâ€”from Babylonia offer themselves as kindling to humanity.																						
117	102		301									Your sacrifices will only end on the day the Punishing Virus no longer threatens humankind.																						
118	103		301									No one speaks of what happens afterward. Not your teachers, not the President.																						
119	104		301									Not to mention that the things Lucia talked about sound more like the past instead of the futureâ€”																						
120	105		301									The unattainable "Golden Age". Whenever you think about it...

123	108		301							1	Lucia	Commandant? You realize you haven't said a word, right?	1																					
124	109		302								I was just thinking about...	110																						
125	110		302								...Something funny.	111																						
126	111		301								Lucia	But, not everyone has Lucia's delicacy...	1																					
127	112		301								Lucia	What is it?	1																					
128	113		301									You do not explain, and Lucia does not ask.																						
129	114		301									But not everyone can read the room...

137	122		301								Kamui	See? Commandant's not going to fault me!	1																					
138	124		301								Chrome	So...? That said, I must admit I'm curious about what you're talking about as well.	2																					
139	999001		301									Seemingly drawn to the commotion, others begin to gather near you.

146	131		301							1	Sophia	Neither have I.	1																					
147	132		301								Sophia	Will Asslam be able to stop if the Punishing Virus is no longer a threat?	1																					
148	133		301								Sophia	The people of Akdilek can then find a piece of fertile land like Jamilah said...	1																					
149	134		301								Sophia	...They'll build a home again, brick by brick, like their ancestors. There will be enough food to feed everyone.	1																					
150	135		302								It'll be so.	136																						
151	136		301								Sophia	But can the future really be that nice?	1																					
152	137		301								Sophia	...No. I'll believe what you said, Commandant.	1

158	143		301								Lee	The future? What about it?	1																					
159	144		201							2	1081001	1	400																					
160	145		301							1	Kamui	Aren't you the slow one, bro? We're talking about what happens after the Punishing Virus is defeated!	2																					
161	146		301								Lee	No one's your "bro"...! After the Punishing Virus is defeated?	1																					
162	147		301								Lee	That's indeed our goal... but it's true that we haven't thought about what will happen to us afterward.	1

164	148		201							1	500155																							
165	149		301							1	Chrome	Right. A natural "lifespan" means nothing to us Constructs anymore.	1																					
166	150		301								Chrome	Theoretically, all of us here will live to see that day. Except for...	1																					
167	256		202							1					1																			
168	151		301									...You feel like everyone turns to look at you at the same time.																						
169	152		301									...You should probably say something...																						
170	153		301									...If only just to make everyone feels better.																						
171	154		302								What?	155																						
172	155		302								I want to collect my pension alive.	156

175	158		301							1	Kamui	Hell yeah! You've been through so much with us, Commandant!	1																					
176	159		301								Kamui	I have absolute faith in you!	1																					
177	160		201							1	500155	1																						
178	161		301							1	Chrome	True. The fight on the surface is going well. It's not a dream that we will establish some kind of safe zone.	1																					
179	162		301								Chrome	...Back to the topic. Let's think about what happens after.	1																					
180	163		201							1	500110	1																						
181	164		301							1	Ayla	Now, as the resident expert on the Golden Age, I'm the most qualified to speak on the "future"!	1

188	171		301							1	Kamui	Spit it out already! Do I get endless video games to play when the Punishing Virus is dealt with?	1																					
189	172		201							1	500110																							
190	173		301							1	Ayla	I suppose... that's actually true.	1																					
191	174		301								Ayla	Considering the output of the game industry during the Golden Age... there will be an infinite number of games available to you, Kamui...	1																					
192	175		201							1	500196																							
193	176		301							1	Karenina	And an infinite number of buildings the Engineering Force has to rebuild, I bet. The future doesn't sound as good all of a sudden.	1																					
194	177		201							1	500155																							
195	178		301							1	Chrome	Kamui, stop fooling around...	1

198	181		201							1	500026																							
199	182		301							1	Lee	Me? I... never really thought about that.	1																					
200	183		301								Lee	If I have to pick something, I'd be working toward getting Murray away from Babylonia duties and that hazardous line of work...	1																					
201	184		302								You're a good brother, Lee.	185	But what about you, Lee?	186																				
202	185	187	301								Lee	No, I don't think I'll actually do that. It's Murray's personal wish to work for Babylonia, after all.	1																					
203	186		301								Lee	That's why I said I never thought about it... I'm content to live to see the day the Punishing Virus is gone.	1																					
204	187		201							1	500166	1																						
205	188		301							1	Lucia	How about we put our heads together and think of something?	1																					
206	189		301								Lucia	Let's do it, Commandant.	1																					
207	190		302								...Sounds fun.	191

210	193		301							1	Lee	H-hold on...	1																					
211	194		301									Everyone begins to chime in with what weird jobs from the Golden Age Lee should do...																						
212	195		201							1	500110																							
213	196		301							1	Ayla	What about a doctor? It fits Lee's characters.	1																					
214	197		201							1	500026																							
215	198		301							1	Lee	I haven't received enough medical training to be any kind of doctor.	1

217	200		201							2	1031001	2	400																					
218	201		301							1	Chrome	I'm sure they'll rebuild "med schools" after the Punishing Virus is gone.	1																					
219	202		301								Liv	Perhaps they'll enroll Constructs as students...	2																					
220	203		201							1	500110	1	-400																					
221	204		301							1	Ayla	Why won't he just "download" the information like how we download battle data...?	1																					
222	205		301								Liv	He can do that, sure, but it sounds nice to learn in a classroom, like how we listen to briefings, doesn't it?	2

224	207		201							1	500026																							
225	208		301							1	Lee	It sounds inefficient.	1																					
226	209		201							1	500110	1																						
227	210		301							1	Ayla	Does that mean you want to find something similar to what you do now, Lee?	1																					
228	211		301								Ayla	Be a dual gunner like Cassidy Ross in "The Dancing Fishmonger Under the Moon"?	1																					
229	212		201							1	500026																							
230	213		301							1	Lee	That's not a "legal" career.	1																					
231	214		301								Lee	Once the threat is gone, I'm sure people will start restoring "law" alongside "order."	1																					
232	215		301								Lee	So, count me out of those risky businesses.	1																					
233	216		302								Then...	217																						
234	217		302								...What about an athlete?	218

239	222		301							1	Liv	Indeed. I've read that swimmers in the past would study fluid mechanics for their performances...	2
