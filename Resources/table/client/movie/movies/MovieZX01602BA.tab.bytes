39	38		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few days ago.																						
40	39		301									A young man with blonde hair stood before the doorway to the conference room. Seeing that the door was ajar, he softly took a breath, then knocked on the door.																						
41	40		301								???	Come in.																						
42	41		201							1	500146																							
43	42		301							1	Murray	Commander Nikola, is there something... Oh, President Hassen. Seems like you've been quite busy recently. I haven't had a chance to speak with you.	1																					
44	43		201							1	500011																							
45	44		301							1	Hassen	...Have a seat.	1																					
46	45		202							1					1																			
47	46		301									Hassen refrained from responding to Murray. Instead, he motioned Murray to take a seat on the other side of the table.																						
48	47		301									Murray sat opposite to Hassen, with a cup of coffee placed in front of him.																						
49	48		301									Murray looked at Hassen through the steam coming from the coffee, then blinked awkwardly.																						
50	49		201							1	500011																							
51	50		301							1	Hassen	There's no need to be nervous. Celica brewed the coffee herself.	1																					
52	51		201							1	500146	1																						
53	52		301							1		Hearing this, Murray smiled and took a sip of the coffee.																						
54	53		301								Murray	Thank you. Tastes... good.	1																					
55	54		202							1					1																			
56	55		301									Standing off to the side, Nikola put down his now empty cup, then turned on the holo-screen.																						
57	56		201							1	500012																							
58	57		301							1	Nikola	I told you, Hassen. He's fine.	1																					
59	58		301								Nikola	Let's get down to business.	1																					
60	59		202							1					1																			
61	60		301									Following Nikola's gesture, Murray shifted his gaze to the content on the holo-screen.																						
62	61		201							1	500146																							
63	62		301							1	Murray	This... this is the report I submitted to you. Is President Hassen here with you because there is an issue with it?	1																					
64	63		202							1					1																			
65	64		201							1	500011		-400																					
66	65		201							2	500012		400																					
67	66		301							1	Hassen	Not with the information itself. What concerns me is how you got it.	1																					
68	67		301									Holding the coffee cup, Murray came to a halt and stayed silent.																						
69	68		301								Nikola	Still not willing to tell us how you got your hands on this information?	2																					
70	69		202							1	2				1																			
71	70		201							1	500146																							
72	71		301							1	Murray	Well... I'd like to live a little longer.	1																					
73	72		301									Murray answered softly with a slightly apologetic tone. However, Hassen understood that the young man would not come clean.																						
74	73		202							1					1																			
75	74		201							1	500011		-400																					
76	75		201							2	500012		400																					
77	76		301							1	Hassen	In that case, why don't you transfer back? It would be better for someone in your condition.	1																					
78	77		202							1	2				1																			
79	78		201							1	500146																							
80	79		301							1	Murray	Thank you for your concern, Mr. President. But I'm happy with my current job. I'm not considering a transfer right now.	1																					
81	80		301								Murray	My intelligence work is just a way for me to accumulate combat experience. After all, my physical condition... doesn't allow me to become a commandant with boots on the ground.	1																					
82	81		202							1					1																			
83	82		201							1	500011		-400																					
84	83		201							2	500012		400																					
85	84		301							1	Nikola	In some ways, I'm happy with the work you produce, and I don't intend to transfer you elsewhere. You're also the only person besides the Gray Raven Commandant who passes the test currently.	2																					
86	85		301									So you should understand that, even if the source of your intel violates our rules, we won't sentence you to death for this.	2																					
87	86		202							1	2				1																			
88	87		301									Murray looked down at his reflection in the coffee cup, obscuring his expression from the two men sitting opposite him.																						
89	88		301									He quickly raised his head again, then the corners of his mouth curled into a gentle, peculiar smile.																						
90	89		201							1	500146	1																						
91	90		301							1	Murray	Sir, I was given a mission, and I completed it. That's all.	1																					
92	91		301								Murray	Just as I won't ask you how you will use this information, you won't have to inquire the details on how I obtain information.	1																					
93	92		202							1					1																			
94	93		201							1	500011		-400																					
95	94		201							2	500012		400																					
96	95		301							1	Nikola	You wouldn't have the authority to ask.	2																					
97	96		202							1	2				1																			
98	97		201							1	500146	1																						
99	98		301							1	Murray	You're right.	1																					
100	99		202							1					1																			
101	100		201							1	500011		-400																					
102	101		201							2	500012		400																					
103	102		301							1	Hassen	We know that what you're doing, at least in terms of results, are still for the benefit of Babylonia.	1																					
104	103		301								Hassen	We seek a common goal. However...	1																					
105	104		301								Hassen	Murray, no matter how many moves you can make behind the scenes, don't you think they can remain hidden forever.	1																					
106	105		301								Hassen	I think you can gauge where the lines are, at least for the time being.	1																					
107	106		202							1	2				1																			
108	107		201							1	500146	1																						
109	108		301							1	Murray	Thank you to both of you for your trust.	1																					
110	109		202							1					1																			
111	110		201							1	500011		-400																					
112	111		201							2	500012		400																					
113	112		301							1	Nikola	You've worked under me for quite some time, but I must admitâ€”I still haven't had you figured out.	2																					
114	113		301									Nikola took out a black folder from a briefcase under the table and pushed it across to Murray.																						
115	114		301								Nikola	If you're unwilling to divulge the source of your intel, the least you can do is be of use.	2																					
116	115		202							1	2				1																			
117	116		201							1	500146	1																						
118	117		301							1	Murray	What do you want me to do?	1																					
119	118		202							1					1																			
120	119		201							1	500011		-400																					
121	120		201							2	500012		400																					
122	121		301							1	Nikola	As always, what you do best.	2																					
123	122		202							1	2				1																			
124	123		301									Murray immediately noticed the logo on the file. He let out an apparent smile, then looked up at Nikola.																						
125	124		201							1	500146																							
126	125		301							1	Murray	...I'm not your only bet in this game, am I?	1																					
127	126		202							1					1																			
128	127		201							1	500011		-400																					
129	128		201							2	500012		400																					
130	129		301							1	Nikola	Just make sure you get the job done.	2																					
131	130		301								Nikola	We just want to see results that benefit Babylonia. That's all.	2																					
132	131		301								Hassen	You can put down your cup of coffee now. You don't have to keep holding it if it isn't to your liking.	1																					
133	132		202							1	2				1																			
134	133		301									After that, Hassen and Nikola stood up and left the conference room, leaving Murray with his coffee, unsure whether or not to drink it.																						
135	134		201							1	500146																							
136	135		301							1	Murray	...	1																					
137	136		301									After quite some time, he finally took a deep breath and smiled bitterly as if being relieved of a heavy burden.																						
138	137		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	That... wasn't very pleasant at all.	1
