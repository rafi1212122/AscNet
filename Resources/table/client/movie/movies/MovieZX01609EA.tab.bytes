41	41		301								Lee	Why did it drop this... when the other one...	2																					
42	42		302								You're right. That one didn't drop anything.	43

46	46		301								Liv	It's a set of coordinates, but I can't decipher the last two data points.	1																					
47	47		301								Liv	Maybe the fragment was solidified with the core of the sub-terminal, and it was damaged when the core disintegrated.	1																					
48	48		301								Lee	How accurate are the coordinates you can retrieve?	2																					
49	49		301								Liv	I can narrow it down to an area of about five to ten square kilometers.	1

87	87		301								Asimov	Looks like a part of the full band lockdown procedure is still in effect.	2

91	91		301								Asimov	Don't worry about the lockdown for now. Lee, go to the terminal in the virtual space to synchronize your data with me.	2																					
92	92		301								Asimov	Gestalt is operating normally now. So if the usual method doesn't work... I still have another way.	2																					
93	93		301									Lee quickly approaches the terminal and begins operating it.																						
94	94		301								Lee	I'm ready on this end, Asimov. Are you ready to start the handshake protocol?	1
