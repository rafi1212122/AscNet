16	16		301								Roland	You're too stiff for the ladies, you know? And I don't mean it as a compliment.	1																					
17	17		301								Gabriel	Not my concern.	2																					
18	18		301								Roland	Not even when it's our dear Miss Luna?	1																					
19	19		301								Roland	Frankly, you really should take a lesson on the art of conversation. Even the Babylonians can't resist when I turn up the charm—they always listen to everything I have to say.	1																					
20	20		301								Roland	Wield it properly, and your tongue can be plenty mighty.	1																					
21	21		301								Gabriel	Excuses for the incompetent. You never were familiar with the concept of humility.	2																					
22	22		301								Roland	I'm flattered.	1																					
23	23		301								Gabriel	...	2																					
24	24		301								Roland	To tell you the truth, I always take you as quite an eccentric individual, but I'm not even remotely close, am I?	1																					
25	25		301								Gabriel	...When an agent of the Ascension-Network goes astray, it is our duty as an Ascendant to correct them.	2																					
26	26		301								Roland	Words of a trusted advisor. Luna must be pleased to know how loyal you are to the Ascnet.	1																					
27	27		301								Roland	That said, she never does anything without her reasons. Have you thought about the consequences of questioning her?	1																					
28	28		301								Gabriel	Have you?	2

34	34		301								Roland	Searching for new "preys," as usual. Obviously.	1																					
35	35		301								Roland	And to quell a bit of my curiosity along the way.	1																					
36	36		301								Gabriel	Does that include operating without Miss Luna's authorization?	2

38	38		301								Roland	...Oops.	1																					
39	39		301								Gabriel	I know you are hiding something, Roland. You cannot conceal it even if you try.	2																					
40	40		301								Roland	...Fine.	1																					
41	41		301									Roland takes out an old hard drive from his windbreaker and throws it toward Gabriel. It glides in a slight arc before Gabriel snaps it out of the air.																						
42	42		301								Roland	Watch it! I didn't make backups.	1																					
43	43		301								Gabriel	What is in it?	2																					
44	44		301								Roland	Nothing of significance, compared to all the researches done by Shome.	1																					
45	45		301								Roland	But... it's better than nothing.	1																					
46	46		204							1	4																							
47	47		301								Roland	Luna didn't seem very pleased with Shome's results. I wanted to find out what she's really after.	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	And if what she's seeking contradicts the ideals of the Ascension-Network...	1																					
49	49		301									Roland quiets down. Having heard what he said, Gabriel turns to stare at him, the uncomfortable silence between them spreading and festering.																						
50	50		301									Eventually, Roland shrugs.																						
51	51		301								Roland	By the way, what are you planning to do with the Core we got?	1																					
52	52		301								Gabriel	I have my plans.	2

61	60		301									In this pool of blood-red mess, something begins to emerge, then crumples, before reforging itself into a new form.

65	64		301								Roland	Looking good, not bad.	1																					
66	65		301								Roland	So what's the difference between this fella and your little pets? It keeps reshaping itself.	1																					
67	66		301								Gabriel	The Hetero-Core you asked about is inside there. Unlike the inferior Rail Heterozygote, this will evolve into the most advanced being that the Punishing Virus has ever touched.	2																					
68	800		301								Gabriel	What you are seeing is it searching for its most efficient, potent form. Only through destruction can it be reborn into a superior vessel.	2																					
69	67		301								Gabriel	Just like... Miss Luna.	2																					
70	68		301								Gabriel	Oh, how our grand vision has come to an impasse.	2																					
71	69		301								Gabriel	You are right about one thing. Miss Luna has not been acting like herself lately.	2																					
72	70		301								Gabriel	She has become content with the status quo. That is not the behavior of a respectable agent of the Ascension-Network.	2																					
73	71		301								Gabriel	To Ascendants, staying put is no different from regression. A sure path to self-annihilation.	2																					
74	72		301								Gabriel	Which is why we require a motivator, something to rekindle her appreciation of her grand mission.	2																					
75	73		301								Roland	With this?	1																					
76	74		301								Gabriel	The strength I have been seeking, the most pure form of power, might just lie within.	2																					
77	75		301								Gabriel	Perhaps if I follow this path, it will not be long before I come across the answer I am looking for. And then...	2																					
78	76		301									Gabriel does not continue his speech. His eyes fixate on the "creature" in front of him, repeating the cycle of decimation and rebirth.

80	78		301								Roland	Out of curiosity, does Alpha know what you're doing?	1																					
81	79		301								Gabriel	She will when the time is right. Now is not it.	2																					
82	80		301								Gabriel	Her perspective is still too shallow, having yet to understand what the Ascension-Network truly means. Miss Luna has never imparted those lessons.	2																					
83	81		301								Roland	It's her long-lost sister, after all. Offering connections instead of burdens sounds like what Luna would do.	1																					
84	82		301								Gabriel	But if such pointless sentiments have wavered her will as an agent, she will require correction.	2																					
85	83		301								Gabriel	There is no price I would not pay for the future of the Ascension-Network.	2
