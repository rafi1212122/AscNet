19	19		301								Lamia	It won't help if I tell you anyway. The blockade here can only be disabled by an Ascendant, which means I'm coming with you!	1

21	21		301							1	Lucia	From what Strike Hawk reported, not only can she disguise herself, she can also turn invisible using optical camouflage, and vanish when we're distracted.	1
