11	11		301									Lucia stands in the way of the creature's path, taking the brunt of the force from the impact. While she manages to stop its advance, she is also knocked down and tossed back several feet.																						
12	12		301									Her system alarm goes off, the warning siren blaring. Her hands are wounded from the crash, and vital fluid is leaking from those openings nonstop.

14	14		301							1	Lucia	It's not over... I can still fight...	1																					
15	15		301									The ashen creature growls at Lucia again in a frenzied rage.																						
16	16		301								Lucia	Are you angry because your source of power is taken away? That's not an emotion you're imitating... Maybe you're a little bit human, after all.	1

19	19		301								Lucia	I've lost my sister, my home... a partner whom I trusted, and a place where I belonged... I've lost my conviction as Lucia...	1																					
20	20		301									Her system keeps recommending turning off her pain receptors and entering her idle state in case she goes into a shock. But Lucia refuses, ignoring the system's warnings.

23	23		301									If she loses consciousness, Luna and you will be in an unsurmountable amount of danger. That is why she has to use the pain to keep herself awake.																						
24	24		301									Her jetpack shield has disintegrated, her power dwindling, the katana in her hand is as damaged as her frame, but...																						
25	25		301								Lucia	But I'll still stand with Commandant and Gray Raven—I will find the answer I am looking for, and this time, I will remember!	1																					
26	26		301									No matter how bleak this fight is, Lucia has found a reason to overcome.																						
27	27		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Lucia looks at you for one last time, and then she raises her katana toward the ashen Hetero-Creature.
