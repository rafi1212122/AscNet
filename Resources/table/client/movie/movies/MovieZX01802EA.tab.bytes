3	3		301			DialogEnable						Despite the dense layer of clouds overhead blotting out the sun, the Earth's surface is still scorching hot.																						
4	4		301									The sand carried in the scorching wind stings your face.

8	7		301							1	Lucia	There it is again!	1																					
9	8		301									The sound echoes through the air. The Red Tide, which was flowing quietly, begins to fill the riverbed once more.																						
10	9		301									Although the sound seems distant, it still seems to resonate from every direction.																						
11	10		301								Lucia	Liv, inject the commandant with a serum. The Red Tide is beginning to rise again. Punishing concentration is rising at an unprecedented rate!	1																					
12	11		201							1	1031001																							
13	12		301							1	Liv	That was the last one. Most of the serum was smashed in the landing. The bit domain node's support frame and even the comms device for contacting the main force were all damaged...	1																					
14	13		201							1	500026																							
15	14		301							1	Lee	How long can we hold out?	1																					
16	15		201							1	1031001																							
17	16		301							1	Liv	Less than two hours.	1																					
18	17		204							1	14																							
19	18		301									Holding the broken bit node, Liv shows a look of guilt.																						
20	19		301								Liv	Sorry, Commandant. I couldn't keep it safe.	1																					
21	20		302								It's okay, Liv.	21	This all happened so quickly. It's not your fault.	22																				
22	21	24	301								Liv	Commandant...	1																					
23	22		201							1	500026																							
24	23		301							1	Lee	The commandant is right. We couldn't have anticipated that.	1																					
25	24		202							1					1																			
26	25		301									The team falls silent.																						
27	26		201							1	500026																							
28	27		301							1	Lee	...Hmph! Can we really trust the Construct that claims to be a part of Strike Hawk?	1																					
29	28		201							1	1031001																							
30	29		301							1	Liv	If he's one of Chrome's comrades...	1																					
31	30		202							1					1																			
32	31		401							2	1508																							
33	32		301									Right at that moment, a Hetero-Creature appears out of nowhere and ambushes the team.

35	34		201							2	500166	5	450

37	36		202							1	2				1																			
38	37		301									Right before the Hetero-Creature is about to stab you with a sharp spike, a bullet pierces the air and penetrates the creature.																						
39	38		301									Still in shock, you cannot help but look in the direction of the shot's trajectory.																						
40	39		301									A white figure looms in the yellow sandstorm.																						
41	40		301								Wanshi	Just a reminder, your comms have been on this whole time.																						
42	41		301								Wanshi	I heard everything you've said.																						
43	42		201							1	500026																							
44	43		301							1	Lee	—!	1																					
45	44		301								Lee	Just now...	1																					
46	45		202							1					1																			
47	46		301								Wanshi	That was me.																						
48	47		301									His languid voice suddenly becomes serious.																						
49	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Wanshi	Quit looking around and get over here.																						
50	49		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory324.png																								
51	50		401							2	1504																							
52	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After quite some time, the four of you finally catch up to the white figure.																						
53	52		201							1	500273																							
54	53		301							1		Before you stands a young man with delicate silver hair and thick dark circles under his eyes.																						
55	54		203							1	0.25	450																						
56	55		201							2	1031001	1	-450																					
57	56		301							1	Liv	Wanshi, correct? Thank you for—	2																					
58	57		301								Wanshi	Uh... Thank me when we get out of this place. Come with me.	1																					
59	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Half-hearted and meaningless greetings are skipped over before they even begin.																						
60	59		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory321.png																								
61	60		401							1	37																							
62	61		201							2	500026		-450																					
63	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lee	What's going on here?	2																					
64	63		301								Wanshi	Er... You first.	1																					
65	64		301								Lee	We ran into turbulence.	2																					
66	65		301									Both sides are concise in their exchange; Lee is not wanting to mince words, Wanshi is too lazy to waste words.																						
67	66		301									Wanshi glances upward.																						
68	67		301								Wanshi	Ah... I figured. Otherwise, that landing was a bit... Um...	1																					
69	68		301									His face turns blank.																						
70	69		301								Wanshi	If it was yesterday, landing here wouldn't have been such an issue.	1																					
71	70		301								Wanshi	Unfortunately... You're a day late.	1																					
72	71		302								You mean...	72																						
73	72		204							1	4																							
74	73		301									Wanshi's troubled eyes widen as he retrains his apathetic tone, then responds seriously.																						
75	74		301								Wanshi	The Red Tide hadn't reached this place until today.	1																					
76	75		301								Wanshi	You'd better see it for yourself rather than me simply tell you.	1																					
77	76		301								Wanshi	Let me start over. I'm Wanshi from Strike Hawk of the Task Force.	1																					
78	77		301								Wanshi	Chrome is my Captain. I'm sure you've met.	1																					
79	78		301								Wanshi	Since the last battle, Strike Hawk has been investigating what's left of the Red Tide and searching for the location of Huaxu in City 075.	1																					
80	79		301								Wanshi	After hearing about the victory against the Polyphage, we stayed on the surface to continue monitoring the Red Tide.	1																					
81	80		301								Wanshi	I was ordered by our Captain to investigate the city's periphery. I was also the first person to inform Babylonia on the Red Tide's activity.	1																					
82	81		301								Wanshi	Since Babylonia dispatched you here, I'll spare the details.	1																					
83	82		302								We are...	85																						
84	83		202							1	2				1																			
85	84		201							1	500273	4																						
86	85		301							1	Wanshi	I know who you are.	1																					
87	86		301								Wanshi	Um... Gray Raven, correct?	1																					
88	87		301								Wanshi	Our Captain mentioned you—especially you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
89	88		204							1																								
90	89		301									Wanshi's seriousness was only momentary. Shortly after, he returns to his usual lazy self.																						
91	90		301								Wanshi	But, um...	1																					
92	91		301								Wanshi	Looks like his description wasn't exactly... Yawn...	1																					
93	92		301									His narrow pair of golden eyes glance at you faintly; he cuts himself off half-way with a long yawn.																						
94	93		302								What was that sound earlier?	94																						
95	94		301								Wanshi	Oh... That...	1																					
96	95		301								Wanshi	It always lasts anywhere from thirty to sixty seconds.	1																					
97	96		302								That long?	97																						
98	97		301								Wanshi	Yeah. Human ears can hear a part of it... The frequency is between ten and forty hertz.	1																					
99	98		301								Wanshi	But you can probably only hear it at above twenty hertz.	1																					
100	99		202							1					1																			
101	100		201							1	500026		450																					
102	101		201							2	500166		-450																					
103	102		301							1	Lee	Whenever the sound starts, the Red Tide begins to spread.	1																					
104	103		301								Lucia	What on earth...	2																					
105	104		302								Sounds like a whale song.	105																						
106	105		202							1	2				1																			
107	106		201							1	500273																							
108	107		301							1	Wanshi	A whale song..? Interesting analogy.	1																					
109	108		202							1					1																			
110	109		301									Human ears can only hear above twenty hertz.																						
111	110		301									Whereas the vocalization of a blue whale is typically between ten and forty hertz. Humans refer to this as a whale song.																						
112	111		301									But this isn't the ocean. This is a desert. How can there be the sound of whales?																						
113	112		301									Not to mention that the life-devouring Red Tide rises whenever it appears.																						
114	113		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				But...	114																						
115	114		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
116	115		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But...																						
117	116		301									If it's a death knell, then...																						
118	117		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					It's far too serene.
