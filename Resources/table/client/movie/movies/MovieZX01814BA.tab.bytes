4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Troy	Looks like the battle here was especially brutal, even the foundation is deformed.	1																					
5	5		301									After confirming that there are no signs of life up ahead, Troy puts down his scope and walks out of the corner of the ruins.

9	9		301							1	Troy	Wanshi, everything checks out on my side. I'm going to head down the tilted foundation and investigate.	1																					
10	10		301								Wanshi	Alright... I've positioned myself in a vantage point nearby.	2																					
11	11		301								Troy	Wow, that was fast.	1																					
12	12		301								Wanshi	That just means I can kick up my feet sooner.	2																					
13	13		301									Troy checks Wanshi's coordinates on his panel, then looks up to see a sniper rifle nestled within a hole in the wall above. Wanshi leans up against the wall and yawns.																						
14	14		301								Troy	You've even set up your weapon. NOW I can count on you...	1																					
15	15		301									Troy leaps forward and arrives at a cluster of buildings under the deformed foundation.																						
16	16		301								Troy	But you noticed it too, didn't you? The marker for the file we've been looking for is flashing in the ruins.	1																					
17	17		301								Troy	We'll finish our mission once I collect it.	1																					
18	18		301								Wanshi	Copy that.	2																					
19	19		301								Troy	Let me check the scan... Alright, I should be able to enter from here.	1

22	22		301									Two collapsed stone slabs on the left and right support each other, forming a space just big enough for one person to enter and exit. Troy kneels down under the stone slabs and steps into the dark ruins in front of him.																						
23	23		301									However, just as Troy wants to move on, he comes into contact with something hard.																						
24	24		201							1	500298																							
25	25		301							1	Troy	Huh? My panel isn't showing anything on the display.	1																					
26	26		401							1	203

36	36		301			RImgBg1Shake	AniZhuanchangBegin					A strong shock interrupts Troy's conversation with Wanshi. The building ruins that Troy entered suddenly shake violently.

39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Rubble and steel bars collapse for the second time. Troy and debris fly out of the collapsed ruins and hit the opposite building, stirring up a cloud of smoke and dust.

42	42		301							1		A dark figure exits the collapsed ruins. The mechanical grinding of machine parts can be heard coming from his torso.	1																					
43	43		301									Wanshi's vision module can only detect an intricate machine and a head tightly bandaged as if out of punishment or atonement.																						
44	44		301									But Wanshi and Troy's panels pick up nothing on the scan. The Babylonian equipment is useless in identifying the figure.																						
45	45		301									No Corrupted response. No Construct response. Not ever a human response. The flashing lights on their scanners indicate that the equipment is operating normally.																						
46	46		301									The position where the figure stands is devoured by thick darkness, even light cannot escape. The moonlight and remaining light within the ruins does not reflect any color.

54	54		301								Troy	Wanshi... I'm okay. That thing... has what we need.	1																					
55	55		301									The dark figure inserts a chip into its chest, causing the mission icon to flash on their display panels.

64	64		301								Gear?	Just an insignificant "gear." My job is to ensure that all operations run smoothly.	1																					
65	65		401							2	1507																							
66	66		301									The dark figure replies and walks toward Troy who fell in the ruins. The gravel at its feet vibrates with each step like a pounding drum.

72	72		301									Wanshi quickly rappels down as he empties his clip. Silver lights rain down on the shadow, only to be deflected in the air by blue lights.																						
73	73		201							1	500288																							
74	74		301							1	Gear?	Is that a threat?	1																					
75	75		301								Gear?	It seems that you can't simply die without pain.	1
