3	3		301									Wanshi stares at the enemy before him. Time seemed to stop momentarily. The air is so quiet; all he can here is his own breath and "Gear's" footsteps.																						
4	4		301								Wanshi	(1...)																						
5	5		301								Wanshi	(2...)																						
6	6		301								Wanshi	(3.)																						
7	7		301									Wanshi counts quietly to himself.																						
8	8		301									Acquiring data. Calculating direction. Adjusting angle.																						
9	9		301									Wanshi had heard everything Chrome and Kamui had encountered over Strike Hawk's encrypted channel.																						
10	10		301									He must avenge Troy, fulfill Arnold's wish, and fight for his comrades.																						
11	11		301									More importantly, he must uphold his faith.																						
12	12		301									In this solemn era, mankind has made countless sacrifices so that they can return to Earth.																						
13	13		301									This goal is not in line with his own. He has known that for quite some time.																						
14	14		301									However, in order to protect those he cares about from sacrificing themselves for this goal, Wanshi's course of action has long been set in stone.																						
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The best he can do right now is to help his comrades and shoot the enemies down, not letting the fallen down, becoming an unyielding flag on the battlefield.

18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Wanshi	...It's over.																						
19	19		301									With the combined forces of the Strike Hawk trio, the threat from "Gear" had finally been neutralized.																						
20	20		301									Wanshi is like the lynchpin in the Strike Hawk's attack, perfectly complimenting Chrome and Kamui's shortcomings. Although his attacks are not fatal, they are always there precisely when they are needed most.																						
21	21		301									While "Gear" was on the defensive, it had forgotten it was fighting three people. Strike Hawk's flawless teamwork had formed into a singular impenetrable wall of attacks.																						
22	22		301									"Gear's" attack had been decimated. It's defenses had been stripped away.																						
23	23		301								Chrome	Don't let up!																						
24	24		401							2	1510																							
25	25		301									Bang—!																						
26	26		301									Wanshi fires a silver orb of light straight at "Gear".																						
27	27		401							2	10002001																							
28	28		301									Chrome swings his scythe, imbuing the orb of light with blue electricity.																						
29	29		401							2	10006001																							
30	30		301									As calculated, the orb strikes "Gear's" head where it had been weakened by Kamui's greatsword.																						
31	31		301								Gear?	It appears... I underestimated you...																						
32	32		401							2	1506																							
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Speaking its last mournful words, "Gear" collapses onto the ground and stops moving.

43	43		301								Wanshi	Yeah. Now we just need to get our hands on the target, and we can call it a day.	2																					
44	44		301									Wanshi slings his sniper rifle over his shoulder and walks toward "Gear's" remains.																						
45	500		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Unbeknownst to the trio, a faint light shines upon them among the lights of the surrounding buildings.

49	48		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After obtaining the file, Wanshi returns to where he had left Arnold.																						
50	49		301									But when Wanshi approaches, he discovers that Arnold is missing. Instead, all that remains is the sphere bot and a can of herring.																						
51	50		301									Wanshi touches the robot, causing Arnold's hologram to project in front of him.

54	53		301							1	Arnold	Goodbye, "human" of the new era.	1																					
55	54		301								Arnold	Maybe it's just me, but...	1																					
56	55		301								Arnold	You are more human than anyone I had ever met in the cities of the Golden Age.	1																					
57	56		301								Arnold	Because you have the passion they don't. You have a "heart."	1																					
58	57		301								Arnold	Don't worry about me. I'm just a human from a bygone era.	1																					
59	58		301								Arnold	Those of us who still remain should be scattered in the wind or buried in the dirt along with the times.	1																					
60	59		301								Arnold	In the past, we were cold, weak and fragile.	1																					
61	60		301								Arnold	We were a fraction of what you have become.	1																					
62	61		301								Arnold	You are far more real than anything we ever were.	1																					
63	62		301								Arnold	You can explore space, or take back Earth for yourselves. It doesn't matter.	1																					
64	63		301								Arnold	It's time for you to start an era that belongs to the Constructs.	1																					
65	64		301								Arnold	Take the can I left you as a token from an ol' soul wanderin' adrift. After all, I gotta shake things up a bit, right? Bahaha!	1																					
66	65		301								Arnold	Well, then. See ya 'round, kiddo.	1

69	68		301									Just as Arnold's message finishes, the sphere bot in Wanshi's hands runs out of power and falls into eternal slumber.

73	72		301									Wanshi places the robot next to the pressure valve, picks up the can of herring, then looks at Chrome and Kamui as they approach from the distance.

75	74		301							1	Kamui	Hey, Wanshi. Let's head back.	1

81	79		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Babylonian transport craft flies into the night sky with a trail of blue flame. The once war-torn city of the Post-Pandemic Age finally returns to tranquil silence.																						
82	80		301									Once the transport craft disappears, two figures appear from within the city ruins.																						
83	81		301								???	They defeated "Chariot".																						
84	82		301								??	No matter. The file we need has been backed up and sent to the organization.																						
85	83		301								??	Its memory shell remembered the mission right before it went offline.																						
86	84		301								???	That sure is callous of you to say... My comrade died right before your eyes.																						
87	85		301								??	Leaving rusty "Gears" will only affect the organization's operation. A timely death is the best course of action.																						
88	86		301								???	Alright... Fair enough,																						
89	87		301								??	Have you finished cleaning up "Chariot"? Now is not the time to make our presence known to Babylonia.																						
90	88		301								???	Of course.																						
91	89		301								???	Alas... Erasing knowledge of "Chariot" from a powerful enemy such as Strike Hawk took considerable effort.																						
92	90		301								???	When I get back, upgrade my data circuit to the latest model as a reward.																						
93	91		301								??	I'll pass the word along.																						
94	92		301								??	Let's go look for "Sage". There are still a lot of preparations for the ceremony before it returns.																						
95	93		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Alright, alright. Hey, slow down! Wait for me...
