10	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Rushing over to the pit created by the blast, the team discovers a dark cave just big enough for one person to squeeze into.																						
11	11		301									Chrome hands the end of a carabiner to Kamui, and cautiously leans down to probe into the cave.																						
12	12		301								Chrome	Looks like there really is a hidden underground region.																						
13	13		301									Chrome picks up a stone and throws it into the darkness. A clang comes echoing from the cavernous depths.																						
14	14		301								Chrome	And it sounds huge.	1

19	19		301							1	Wanshi	Does it look like an underground waterway? When I came here to explore, I heard that there were several access points near the Red Tide, but they were all abandoned pipelines that should've been taken care of.	3																					
20	20		301								Chrome	Looks like the access point was more hidden than we thought. Considering how low the Punishing concentration is, I'm guessing it's not accumulating here for the time being. We must've detected the spike as it passed through.	1																					
21	21		301								Chrome	Not to mention, whoever used our discovery to rush in before the smoke cleared must be familiar with the area.	1																					
22	22		301								Chrome	If I'm not mistaken, there should be a deeper network connected with the core region that was destroyed by the Longinus Arsenal.	1																					
23	23		301								Chrome	Otherwise, I can't imagine how the Red Tide would move undetected.	1																					
24	24		301								Wanshi	The core area was flooded by the Red Tide. So, it's no surprise that we couldn't detect the access point if it was hidden underneath it.	3																					
25	25		301								Wanshi	But even after the Longinus strike, we still couldn't detect it...	3																					
26	26		301								Wanshi	Think it was quickly covered up by someone?	3																					
27	27		301								Chrome	Given the footprints and the person that just ran in, there must be an enemy base that we haven't detected yet.	1																					
28	28		301								Kamui	We need to go down, Captain! Whether that be to eradicate the Red Tide or put a stop to any potential threats...	2																					
29	29		301								Wanshi	This feels like a trap. Seems like someone is rolling out the red carpet for us.	3																					
30	30		301								Wanshi	Are we really going down there?	3

32	32		301									Chrome pauses, then throws a glow stick into the cave and inspects the waterway's interior.																						
33	33		301									The interior is vast, and the surrounding walls, illuminated by the light source, reveal signs of damage and peeling as if silently recounting the past.																						
34	34		301									A faint trickling comes from just out the glow stick's reach. Dreadful red liquid drips from a cracked pipe in the ceiling.																						
35	35		301									The mist created from the splashing red liquid mottles the glow stick, staining the light red.

41	41		301								Chrome	But if we return to Babylonia, it's not like we'll receive any additional support.	1																					
42	42		301								Chrome	Not many Task Forces have returned to Babylonia in one piece lately. They still need time to repair their frames. The remaining teams are still out on missions.	1																					
43	43		301								Kamui	Not just missions... I went to go speak with Lee this morning, but I was prohibited from entering the preparation room.	2																					
44	44		301								Wanshi	Who stopped you?	3																					
45	45		301								Kamui	Some guy in a suit. He had a chip on his shoulder, that's for sure.	2

57	57		301									If the timer expires before he cancels it, the distress call will be immediately relayed to Babylonia.																						
58	58		301									After transmitting the report to Babylonia, Chrome signals the others to proceed into the underground waterway.

76	76		301									Chrome looks down and inspects Wanshi's back, discovering the addition of what appears to be a button.																						
77	77		301									Had it not been for his familiarity with his team, such a minute detail would have surely gone overlooked.																						
78	78		301									He gently grabs the "button," then removes it from Wanshi's frame.

91	91		301								Camu	Hmph. Leave them to me.	1

107	107		301									The sound of running water and Camu's enraged voice can be heard coming up from the hole.

114	114		301								Camu	Don't jump down! The Red Tide is here.																						
115	115		301								Chrome	Alright, we'll find another route down to rendezvous with you. We'll split up and investigate for now.	1																					
116	116		301								Camu	I told you I was going to scout ahead!																						
117	117		301									He walks away, cursing under his breath. Right at that moment, a strange noise comes from the other side of the previously quiet waterway.																						
118	118		301								Kamui	What's that over there?	2																					
119	119		202							1	2	3			1

126	126		301									After fumbling for half an hour as they infiltrate the winding network of tunnels, Chrome finally discovers an entrance in the distance behind a curtain.																						
127	127		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Informing his two comrades, they extinguish the glow sticks and stick them in their bags as they quietly approach.

135	135		301								Chrome	Shh! Be quiet.	1																					
136	136		301									Kamui nods and lowers his volume.																						
137	137		301								Wanshi	An old room like this seems to have been a part of the waterway.	3																					
138	138		301								Chrome	Finding a structure like this must mean this isn't just a waterway...	1																					
139	139		301								Chrome	Maybe it has something to do with the underground city.	1																					
140	140		301									Right as the two of them are lost in though, a "fish" floats in front of Kamui.

143	143		301								??	A Hetero-Creature?																						
144	144		301									Suddenly, the gentle and quiet voice of a girl comes from behind the trio. There is no sense of aggression in her voice. Had they been elsewhere, the presence of a quiet schoolgirl would not have batted an eye.																						
145	145		301								Chrome	Who goes there?	1																					
146	146		202							1	2	3			1																			
147	147		301									Looking in the direction of the voice, they see a feeble girl standing among a school of fish-shaped Hetero-Creatures approaching Chrome.

163	163		301								??	No... I'm not an Ascendant yet.	1																					
164	164		301									With each slash from Kamui's greatsword, an endless stream of fish stands in his way. The girl, however, remains standing there motionless, seemingly oblivious to the attack.

172	172		301									Continuing to fight won't be a fruitful endeavor. Fortunately, their opponent seems open to discussion, so they should be able to at least gather some information.
