12	11		301								Kamui	Gabriel!	1																					
13	12		301								Gabriel	If it isn't more Babylonian scum? Struggle as you will, it will only be in vain.	2

15	14		201							1	500155																							
16	15		301							1	Chrome	Gabriel, our database has you marked as Luna's henchman. Does that mean Luna and the other Ascendants are here, too?	1																					
17	16		201							1	500101																							
18	17		301							1	Gabriel	Other Ascendants?	1																					
19	18		301									Gabriel's vocalizer forces out a sardonic sneer.																						
20	19		301								Gabriel	Those cowards who betrayed the Ascension-Network no longer have any right to reside here.	1																					
21	20		301								Gabriel	Their whereabouts are of no concern to me.	1

26	25		301								Gabriel	Only those that possess absolute power and power itself are worthy of my attention.	1																					
27	26		201							1	1081001																							
28	27		301							1	Kamui	Then why are you still here at the former base?	1																					
29	28		201							1	500101																							
30	29		301							1	Gabriel	Because of "der Meister".	1																					
31	30		301									Gabriel's voice fills with reverence and devotion.																						
32	31		301								Gabriel	After that battle, he bestowed me with a new life and allowed me to bear witness to a new zenith of power.	1

40	39		301							1	Gabriel	Roland...	1																					
41	40		301									Uttering this name, Gabriel's tone returns to its former coldness.																						
42	41		301								Gabriel	The "Meister" I refer to is a different agent.	1																					
43	42		301								Gabriel	Roland is nothing more than a traitor to the Ascension-Network.	1																					
44	43		201							1	500273	7																						
45	44		301							1	Wanshi	Looks like they have themselves a new agent...	1																					
46	45		201							1	500101																							
47	46		301							1	Gabriel	Puny minds. Does the existence of a new agent come as a surprise?	1																					
48	47		201							1	500273																							
49	48		301							1	Wanshi	...Just another nuisance is all.	1																					
50	49		201							1	500101																							
51	50		301							1	Gabriel	Then let me share with you more good news.	1																					
52	51		301								Gabriel	Aside from der Meister, there is yet another agent nearby that is beyond your understanding.	1																					
53	52		201							1	500155																							
54	53		301							1	Chrome	So there are three agents?	1																					
55	54		201							1	500101																							
56	55		301							1	Gabriel	As I've said, there are only two. As for Miss Luna's whereabouts, I do not know. Any attempt to reconfirm this will only yield the same answer.	1																					
57	56		301								Gabriel	If you're so curious, I suggest you ask your colleagues. I'm sure they are more aware of this situation, considering how long they have been tracking her.	1																					
58	57		201							1	500155																							
59	58		301							1	Chrome	You mean Babylonia has been tracking Luna this whole time?	1																					
60	59		201							1	500101																							
61	60		301							1	Gabriel	Of course. Ever since Miss Luna became an agent right under Babylonia's nose, humanity has coveted her power.	1																					
62	61		301									Gabriel pulls out his cane from the side of his cloak and points it at Chrome standing in front.																						
63	62		301								Gabriel	As oblivious as you all are, there's no sense in continuing this conversation.	1																					
64	63		301								Gabriel	I'd rather finish you myself than disturb der Meister.	1																					
65	64		201							1	1081001																							
66	65		301							1	Kamui	Seems like you're his number one fan.	1

68	67		301									Gabriel takes a step forward. Red sparks begin to emit from his footprints, intertwining with his cold mechanical limbs.

70	69		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryRedSmokeNew.prefab		1																						
71	70		301							1	Gabriel	Der Meister saved me from the brink of death and bestowed me with this newfound power.	1																					
72	71		301								Gabriel	Now, bear witness to this power.	1

74	73		202							1					1																			
75	74		301									Countless red photons coalesce in Gabriel's palm. As he clutches the bright cube, light erupts from the palm of his hand.																						
76	75		301									Amid the blinding red light, Gabriel launches himself headlong at Strike Hawk!																						
77	76		201							1	500155																							
78	77		301							1	Chrome	Defensive formation!	1																					
79	78		202							1					1																			
80	79		301			RImgBg1Shake						The walls of the greenhouse begin to turn into rubble in the seismic tremors. Smoke and dust fill the room.																						
81	80		301									The defensive formation barely manages to withstand the full might of Gabriel's attack. However, they know now that combat data on Gabriel was far from reality.																						
82	81		201							1	500101																							
83	82		301							1	Gabriel	I take back what I said. You all might be clueless, but you are just like those Gray Ravensâ€”troubles.	1																					
84	83		202							1					1

88	87		301							1	Kamui	You know Gray Raven?	2																					
89	88		301									Gabriel refrains from answering. Another cube of red light begins to coalesce in his hand. Before it can materialize, it is disrupted by Kamui's greatsword.																						
90	89		301								Chrome	Kamui! Don't be reckless!	1																					
91	90		301								Kamui	Captain! Butâ€”	2																					
92	91		301								Chrome	Fight as a team!	1																					
93	92		301								Kamui	Roger!	2																					
94	93		202							1	2	3			1																			
95	94		301									Chrome steps forward. The blade of his scythe swings in an arc. Wanshi swiftly leaps over his two comrades surrounding Gabriel and delivers a direct strike to Gabriel's skull from above.																						
96	95		301									Red light erupts from the blow, unleashing a wave of highly concentrated Punishing Virus into their Inver-Devices. Searing pain spreads across their neurolinks and penetrates deep into their M.I.N.D.s like a sharp blade drilling into their bones.																						
97	96		201							1	500155																							
98	97		301							1	Chrome	Pull back!	1																					
99	98		202							1					1																			
100	99		301									Kamui swings his greatsword backward. Using the inertia of the blast, he defends against the attack and pulls back several meters.																						
101	100		301									Chrome raises his scythe to catch the falling Wanshi, then flings him toward Kamui.																						
102	101		201							1	1081001	2																						
103	102		301							1	Kamui	Nice pass!	1																					
104	103		301									Kamui catches Wanshi, then gives Chrome a thumbs up.

106	105		201							2	500273	8	450																					
107	106		301							1	Wanshi	...Think you can put me down first?	2																					
108	107		202							1	2				1																			
109	108		301									The narrow confines of the greenhouse limit Gabriel's movement. Unable to fly into the air, all he can do is swing his cane and attack the trio with the help of the Punishing Virus.																						
110	109		301									â€”CLANG!																						
111	110		301									Chrome adeptly parries Gabriel's lunge with his scythe. He quickly retracts his weapon, then uses this window of opportunity to leap into the air and slash at his opponent.																						
112	111		201							1	500101																							
113	112		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryRedSmokeNew.prefab		1																						
114	113		301									Gabriel is forced to step back in a hurry. Pulling off his cloak, countless red lights envelop him in preparation to unleash another explosion.																						
115	114		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryRedSmokeNew.prefab		1																					
116	115		201							1	500308																							
117	116		301							1	Cinderelik	Gabriel, Mother... is still resting.	1

122	121		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryRedSmokeNew.prefab		1																					
123	122		301									The red light in the greenhouse suddenly disperses in response to the girl. Gabriel retracts his weapon and glares at the nearby trio in contempt.																						
124	123		201							1	500179																							
125	124		301							1	Gabriel	No need to fight in the narrow confines of the greenhouse.	1																					
126	125		201							1	1081001																							
127	126		301							1	Kamui	Don't think you can run!	1																					
128	127		201							1	500179																							
129	128		301							1	Gabriel	Run? No... I just don't want to ruin der Meister's plan.	1																					
130	129		201							1	1081001																							
131	130		301							1	Kamui	What the hell does that mean?	1																					
132	131		202							1					1																			
133	132		301									Gabriel sighs in disdain, responding vaguely.																						
134	133		201							1	500179																							
135	134		301							1	Gabriel	Do you really wish to see der Meister? Leave with me, and I'll give you an opportunity to fulfill your dying wish.	1																					
136	135		301								Gabriel	If you insist on staying here, I can accompany you to the end.	1																					
137	136		202							1					1																			
138	137		301									With that, Gabriel takes Cinderelik and opens a door on the other side of the greenhouse, then stares at the trio.																						
139	138		201							1	500155																							
140	139		201							2	1081001		600																					
141	140		201							3	500273		-600																					
142	141		301							1	Kamui	Perfect. Wait until I get my hands on this guy when I see him!	2																					
143	142		301								Chrome	Seems like a trap.	1																					
144	143		301								Wanshi	If we stay here and fight, getting crushed when the room caves in ain't much better.	3																					
145	144		301								Wanshi	Maybe it's a good idea to get out of this place.	3																					
146	145		301								Chrome	They won't let us leave now that we know about the new agent. Also, we can't just ditch Camu. He doesn't know what happened here.	1																					
147	146		301								Kamui	Then let's follow him while we wait for Camu. Whaddaya say, Captain?	2																					
148	147		301								Chrome	Wait... Wanshi, who do you think Cinderelik meant by "Mother"?	1																					
149	148		301									Wanshi ponders the question a while, then quietly spits out a series of unlikely explanations.																						
150	149		301								Wanshi	Based on the word, Mother could refer to... one of the agents mentioned earlier, a Corrupted... or even a new type of Hetero-Creature.	3																					
151	150		301									Chrome still has concerns, considering that, whatever the true identity of this "Mother" figure is, it will only put the team in danger of being attacked.																						
152	151		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He nods to Kamui and Wanshi, signaling them to leave the greenhouse.																						
153	152		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory273.png																								
154	153		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Following Gabriel and Cinderelik, the trio walks down the spacious waterway and arrives at a platform lift.																						
155	154		301								Kamui	Why would a platform lift be here in a waterway?	2																					
156	155		301								Wanshi	It's not that surprising. We DID just come from an underground greenhouse, after all.	3																					
157	156		301								Wanshi	I don't think this waterway was really built to drain wastewater.	3																					
158	157		301								Kamui	Think the Ascendants stay here often?	2																					
159	158		301								Chrome	This place might be connected with City 075. Considering that it was a military facility built to prevent war, I wouldn't be surprised if it served multiple functions.	1																					
160	159		301								Chrome	From what we've observed along the way, I'd assume it's been abandoned for quite some time.	1																					
161	160		202							1	2	3			1																			
162	161		301									Chrome motions to Kamui to keep his voice down. The trio slows their pace, distancing themselves from Cinderelik and Gabriel up ahead.																						
163	162		201							1	500155																							
164	163		201							2	1081001		600																					
165	164		201							3	500273		-600																					
166	165		301							1	Chrome	This is just a theory, but I think this abandoned corridor was opened on short notice as a response to the Longinus Arsenal.	1																					
167	166		301								Chrome	And I'm guessing it was abandoned due to the quality of the facility.	1																					
168	167		301								Wanshi	I think you're right. Any more earthquakes, and this waterway is going to collapse.	3																					
169	168		301								Wanshi	Why is this the only shoddy part of the facility?	3																					
170	169		301								Chrome	A section of the report on City 075 stated that the facility was expanded to isolate the infected prior to developing the serum.	1																					
171	170		301								Chrome	But the Punishing Virus spread faster than anticipated. The facility was abruptly abandoned before it saw any use.	1																					
172	171		202							1	2	3			1																			
173	172		301									As they are talking, Gabriel and Cinderelik disappear around the corner. The trio accelerates their pace to catch up.																						
174	173		301									Among the flurry of footsteps, Chrome hears Camu on the Strike Hawk comm link.																						
175	174		301								Camu	...Where... you guys...																						
176	175		301									Even though the Strike Hawk comm link is more stable than most, his voice intermittently cuts out due to the unique jamming technology of the underground city.																						
177	176		201							1	500155																							
178	177		201							2	1081001		600																					
179	178		201							3	500273		-600																					
180	179		301							1	Chrome	We're on the platform lift down here in the waterway. What's your location?	1																					
181	180		301								Camu	...Maze... down here.																						
182	181		301								Camu	I'm... going... platform lift... Wait there.																						
183	182		301								Chrome	Alright, we'll wait for you.	1																					
184	183		301									Right as Chrome terminates the comm link, the group sees Cinderelik, who had disappeared around the corner, now floating in the air.																						
185	184		301									Even though her damaged wing makes flight toilsome, four fish-like Hetero-Creatures tightly grip the straps on her clothes and pull her upward.																						
186	185		301								Kamui	I guess those straps aren't just for looks! Captain, I want a pair of my own!	2																					
187	186		301								Chrome	I'll help you put in a request, but don't get your hopes up.	1																					
188	187		301								Chrome	Now's not the time, though. I wasn't expecting this kind of escape route from them.	1																					
189	188		202							1	2	3			1																			
190	189		201							1	500179																							
191	190		301							1	Gabriel	Wrong. I'm not going anywhere.	1																					
192	191		301								Gabriel	Cinderelik is no longer needed here. I'm more than enough to serve as your guide.	1																					
193	192		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	Come with me.	1
