5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Vera	Good. Fantastic discovery.	1																					
6	6		204							1																								
7	7		301								Vera	But it's got nothing to do with our mission, so let's stick to the target coordinates.	1																					
8	8		301								Noctis	But surely a sign that obvious is trying to catch our attention?	3																					
9	9		301								Vera	You just wanna make a fuss, don't you?	1																					
10	10		301								Noctis	There are four of us here. I don't see why we can't just split the party and let me go after whoever left the graffiti...	3																					
11	11		302								He's not wrong.	12	Let's focus on the mission for now.	12																				
12	12		301									Noctis reaches out and touches the words, and the paint stains his finger red.																						
13	13		301								Noctis	This is still fresh. Maybe it's from the Ascendant we've been looking for?	3																					
14	14		302								That's not her style.	15																						
15	15		301								Vera	You know Ascendants pretty well, don't you?	1																					
16	16		301									Vera says impassively, and you are not sure if she is simply stating a fact or teasing you.																						
17	17		301				DialogDisable				Vera	Fine—that means we've got a third party involved. What do you think we should do next?	1																					
18	18		302								We can't call off the mission...	19																						
19	19		302								But we shouldn't let go of such a glaring trail either.	20																						
20	20		301			DialogEnable	DialogDisable				Vera	So?	1																					
21	21		302								Send one person to investigate the coordinates with me.	22																						
22	22		302								The other two will look for our "mystery guest."	23																						
23	23		301			DialogEnable					Vera	Well, we can't leave Noctis and 21 by themselves. Neither of them is good at tracking, per se.	1																					
24	24		301								Vera	It's obvious, then—let's split up. We'll each take one of them and track our targets while staying in contact. Say, we meet again in an hour?	1																					
25	25		302								Agreed.	26																						
26	26		301								Vera	Alright, who's with me—	1

31	31		301							1	No. 21 & Noctis	Me.	2	3																				
32	32		204							1	1																							
33	33		301								Vera	...That won't do. Someone has to babysit the commandant.	1																					
34	34		301								Noctis	Don't keep me from hunting ghosts! 21 is great, Gray Raven Commandant! You should totally team up with her.	3																					
35	35		301								No. 21	...	2																					
36	36		301								Vera	What do you say, Commandant?	1																					
37	37		302								I'll take Noctis with me.	38	I'll take No. 21 with me.	39																				
38	38	40	301								Noctis	(Laughs) I refuse.	3																					
39	39		301								Vera	(Nods) Consider your opinion ignored. I didn't say I care about what you think, did I?	1																					
40	40		302								...	41																						
41	41		204							1																								
42	42		301								Vera	Well, that's enough teasing you for now. I don't think either of them will follow your orders, but it's not like we have options right now.	1																					
43	43		204							1	1																							
44	44		301								Vera	So... 21, you'll stay here with the commandant and investigate the coordinates.	1																					
45	45		301									Vera's smile makes you think that something is afoot here.																						
46	46		301								No. 21	...	2																					
47	47		301								No. 21	...Understood.	2																					
48	48		301								Noctis	Right! Let's get going! I'll snoop around that area first, yeah?	3																					
49	49		202							1	2	3			1																			
50	50		301									Noctis bounces off as if he has springs under his feet, and he dashes away.

52	52		201							2	500328	4	450																					
53	53		301							1	Vera	Let's take the opportunity to switch the remote connection target.	1																					
54	952		202							1																								
55	953		203							2	0.25																							
56	54		301								No. 21	...	2																					
57	55		301									No. 21 has not voiced her objection, but the Co-Bot beside her starts twirling, agitated, its reluctance plain as day.																						
58	56		302								No. 21, I'm going to connect with you now.	57																						
59	57		301								No. 21	Capt. already said it.	2																					
60	58		302								It might be a little turbulent.	59																						
61	59		301								No. 21	...	2																					
62	60		302								Let me know when you're ready?	61																						
63	61		301									She falls silent again.																						
64	62		301								No. 21	...Don't question.	2																					
65	63		301								No. 21	Capt. arranged it. I accepted it. I don't question.	2																					
66	64		302								...Alright.	65																						
67	65		301									No. 21 is acting very uneasily, seemingly uncomfortable with the fact that someone is asking about her feelings. But this will have to do now.																						
68	66		302								(Request to switch connection target)	67																						
69	67		202							1	2				1																			
70	68		301								Adjustment Operator	Hold on.																						
71	69		301									Rebecca's voice appears in your comms.																						
72	70		301				DialogDisable				Rebecca	Is that necessary, Gray Raven Commandant?																						
73	71		302								It is.	72																						
74	72		302								We've encountered a third party in the town.	73																						
75	73		301			DialogEnable					Rebecca	A third party... Fine. But I must stress that connecting with No. 21 might trigger unexpected risks.																						
76	74		302								It's our best option for now.	75	It's riskier to let our mystery person go.	75																				
77	75		301								Rebecca	We haven't found any trace of this third party, and we're going to investigate at the same time. Meanwhile, we'll do as you say. I'll try to stay out of your way unless absolutely necessary.																						
78	76		301								Rebecca	...But I'd like to remind you of your objective here. I'll disconnect you with No. 21 if any accident occurs.																						
79	77		302								I understand.	78																						
80	78		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Rebecca	Good luck, Commandant.

84	82		301			RImgBg1Shake	AniZhuanchangBegin					As you expected, the connection with No. 21 is far from smooth sailing. You have to make some effort to calm her M.I.N.D. from rejecting your consciousness.																						
85	83		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory383.png																								
86	84		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						When you open your eyes again, you are looking from No. 21's perspective and find Vera smiling and waving at you.																						
87	85		201							1	500168	1																						
88	86		301							1	Vera	Okay, then—I'll leave you to 21. She's a good kid. Take care of her.	1																					
89	87		202							1					1																			
90	88		401							2	885																							
91	89		301								Noctis	Surprise! Look what I've found!																						
92	90		301									A speeding police car stops before you, and Noctis pokes his head out from the rolled-down window wearing a pair of sunglasses he has found, whistling loudly.																						
93	91		201							1	500168		-450																					
94	92		201							2	500336		450																					
95	93		301							1	Noctis	There's a precinct nearby with a bunch of these babies parked outside.	2																					
96	94		301								Vera	Nope.	1																					
97	95		204							2	4																							
98	96		301								Noctis	C'mon, I checked! It might look scrappy, but the frame is still intact, and the engine still works...	2																					
99	97		301								Vera	Unless I get to drive, I'll never sit inside a vehicle with you behind the wheel. Do you understand me?	1																					
100	98		301								Noctis	Fine, I'm not as petty as you. I trust your driving skill... It can't be as terrible as 21's, can it?	2																					
101	99		202							1	2				1																			
102	100		201							1	500328																							
103	101		301							1	No. 21	?	1																					
104	102		202							1					1																			
105	103		401							2	1512																							
106	104		301									Vera opens the door and hops on the driver's seat before slamming the door shut. With an arm resting on the rolled-down window, she waves at you.																						
107	105		201							1	500168	13																						
108	106		301							1	Vera	Commandant—enjoy the thrill as a Cerberus!	1																					
109	107		201							1	500328																							
110	108		301							1	No. 21	...	1																					
111	109		401							2	885																							
112	110		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The police car speeds away, leaving No. 21 and her Co-Bot behind.
