6	6		301							1	Shrek	Watanabe's situation isn't looking good either, but at least they promised to send a doctor and even offered to take in some refugees if the situation takes a turn for the worse. Thanks for letting me use your terminal.	1																					
7	7		301									Shrek terminates the call and hands the terminal back to Lee.																						
8	8		201							1	500026																							
9	9		301							1	Lee	You said you were going to call the Forsaken to send someone over, but you obviously didn't have a way of reaching them.	1

11	11		301							1	Shrek	I did just now, didn't I?	1																					
12	12		301									He points at Lee's terminal matter as if stating the obvious.																						
13	13		301								Shrek	People need to rely on each other to survive in this world, so we can't just think about what we have. At a time like this, even more so.	1																					
14	14		301									He gestures to Lee, who gives him a dull look.

18	18		301								Lee	Just be more prepared next time before making promises.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	Considering how many accidents we've had recently, what would you have done if you couldn't reach them?	1

24	24		301							1	Lucia	It's fine, Lee. Doesn't matter whose terminal he uses as long as everything works out.	1																					
25	25		301								Lucia	How are things with you, Liv?	1																					
26	26		301								Liv	I checked everyone's vitals and re-bandaged everyone's wounds that opened up from all the bumps along the way.	2																					
27	27		301								Liv	Sorry for writing in your book, Shrek...	2																					
28	28		301									She returns the book titled "Comfort for the Soul" back to Shrek, now full of medical notes.

36	36		301								Akane	It's okay... Miss Liv... I understand...	1																					
37	37		301								Liv	I only had time to make you a small one on the way here. If I return to City 043's conservation area, I'll make another one for you. Okay?	2																					
38	38		301								Akane	Really?! THANKS!	1
