9	9		301									She hadn't paid much attention to it during the test because of the hasty procedure, but in retrospect, the power of the weapon is the key to saving the world.																						
10	10		301									If we could test it again with adequate preparation, we would surely achieve better results, right?

16	16		301								Lucia	Yes, I was thinking about that too. I remember it could absorb the Punishing Virus, something that had never happened before.	2																					
17	17		301								Liv	About that...	1																					
18	18		301									Liv tells Lucia what she thinks.																						
19	19		301								Lucia	Apply for the testing program again?	2																					
20	20		301									She thinks about it for a moment.																						
21	21		301								Lucia	Good idea. The previous test was too hasty. If we're better prepared this time, we'll definitely get better results.	2																					
22	22		301								Lucia	Once we eliminate the Punishing Virus, we'll solve many other problems too.	2																					
23	23		301								Lucia	Yes, I remember the look on Lee's face when he saw the test data. I'm sure he wants to try again too.	2

79	79		301									What if the Punishing Virus is gone?																						
80	80		301									The Omega Weapon can make that happen. That's what everybody has been waiting for. Liv knows she can't let this opportunity slip away.

124	122		301								???	In the war against the Punishing Virus, humans have never won a true victory.																						
125	123		301								???	According to the calculation of Gestalt, no one will survive this catastrophe if effective measures are not taken.																						
126	124		301								???	At the outbreak of the catastrophe in the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, the Science Council had already made a preliminary recreation of the technology recorded in the Omega File.																						
127	125		301								???	We managed to retrieve and analyze the test data of the Omega Prototype through the contact of the Gray Raven with the Unidentified Twins.

137	135		301								Liv	A carrier?	1

139	137		301								Liv	Through my M.I.N.D.?	1																					
140	138		301								???	That's the only way to maximize the effect of the Omega Weapon.																						
141	139		301								???	This is a dangerous task, because we can't control the rate of attraction of the virus, and once it exceeds the rate of absorption by the Omega Weapon, you'll get infected completely.																						
142	140		301								???	In addition to that, there is also a high risk that your frame won't be able to reboot again or use recall due to symptoms such as M.I.N.D. deviation and contamination.																						
143	141		301								???	But in order to reclaim Earth and go back to our common home, we must do whatever it takes to overcome the predicament.

152	150		301								Liv	Yes.	1																					
153	151		301								???	Please confirm that you can't quit the mission once you take it.

155	153		301								???	Please confirm that you are aware of the dangers of this mission.

284	281		301								Teen Construct	Do you know that the underground base in City 047 was left behind by Kurono, and there remains a lot of supplies as well as transports?	13																					
285	282		301								Teen Construct	I don't know why they suddenly figured it out and decided to give the Parliament permission.	13																					
286	283		301								Teen Construct	The Parliament now wants to use the supplies in that base for disaster relief. That's why so many people are going to City 047.	13

313	310		301									The last time she felt that way was when she was on her way to capture the Ascendant by order of Ravenge. Is this just a coincidence?

320	317		301								Lucia	Sorry, I was overreacting. Alright, let's make a plan.	2																					
321	318		301								Lucia	The President said there were plenty of supplies in the base, so I'm sure everybody wants to get their hands on them.	2																					
322	319		301								Lucia	We're pretty close to the underground base and we have plenty of time to do round trips. So I suggest we take everyone there in different groups.	2

331	328		301								Construct Soldier 1	Okay, it's not going to be a dangerous trip, but we need escorts, just to be on the safe side. I'll stay for now. Two vehicles can't hold everybody, so I guess we'll have to make a few more trips.	2

393	390		301								Lucia	Most people couldn't be bothered with things like that, and none of the other commandants stepped in.	2																					
394	391		301								Liv	Yes, I still remember the commandant said "Just because a single cog can't stand up to the enemy doesn't mean it should be left behind." I totally agree.	1																					
395	392		301								Liv	...Whether it's a human or an animal, or even an insect or a bacterium, just because they seem "weak" doesn't mean they should be dismissed.	1
