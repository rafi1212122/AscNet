82	82	96	301									Ayla decides to accept your answer as she focuses all her attention on the theater play by Selena.																						
83	83		301								Ayla	What poetry?	1																					
84	84		302								What Can I Hold You With?	85	It's poetry by Borges.	87																				
85	85		301								Ayla	...I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow.	1																					
86	86		302								That's the one.	87	Where did you read this?	87																				
87	87		301								Ayla	I read it when I was reading the work of some famous poets, writers, and translators from the Golden Age. It was a pile of brittle papers lost in history and known by only a few of the new generation in Babylonia.	1																					
88	88		301								Ayla	And I heard this from Selena as well.	1																					
89	89	96	301								Ayla	She mentioned it in a mail. It was her favorite poetry. And she used that quote at the end of one of her stories.	1																					
90	90		301									Ayla looks at you. It seems she wants to say something, but eventually decides not to.																						
91	91		301								Ayla	...You and Selena are similar in that aspect.	1

110	110		301									Ayla interrupts your reminiscence.																						
111	111		302								Tell her the summary of that story	124	Tell her the ending is different	124	Hamlet is in the story.	112																		
112	112		301								Ayla	I think you most likely triggered what we call the fourth wall.	1																					
113	113		302								The fourth wall?	114	The fact I saw Hamlet shows the fourth wall was broken.	115	I don't understand.	117																		
114	114	122	301									The fourth wall is a theatrical term. Simply put, it's the invisible wall that separates the actors from the audience in a play. "Breaking that fourth wall" means you remove the veil between reality and the play, and it has became a new genre of theatre since realism became a thing.																						
115	115		204							1																								
116	116	121	301								Ayla	I guess you are the Chief for a reason.	1																					
117	117		301								Ayla	The way Hamlet works is basically treating tragedies as the "best solutions." That is exactly why even though Selena wrote more than just one ending, the script will always draw to a tragic ending.	1																					
118	118		302								Is this one of the reasons why that machine is called Hamlet?	119	Is it possible for it to alter the data of theater play?	120																				
119	119	122	301								Ayla	I think that is possible. After all, Hamlet was considered one of the Four Tragedies by Shakespeare back in the Golden Age.	1																					
120	120	122	301								Ayla	Hamlet doesn't have the ability to do that. It operates based on the processing of source data added by real humans and doesn't deviate from that because it is encoded like DNAs.	1																					
121	121		204							1	4																							
122	122		301								Ayla	So, as a performer in the play, you helped the non-tragic ending make more sense using the characters' reasonable actions and broke the fourth wall in the process. That was why Hamlet showed up during the play.	1																					
123	123		301								Ayla	This doesn't come as a surprise considering that method is already encoded...	1																					
124	124		301								Ayla	Anyway... the evil dragon has been defeated. And both the champion and the piper survived, right?	1																					
125	125		301								Ayla	And the piper embarked on her journey in the end, right?	1																					
126	126		204							1																								
127	127		301								Ayla	I prefer this ending to the previous ones.	1																					
128	128		302								Me too.	129	I would say embarking on a journey alone is too lonely.	131																				
129	129		204							1	19																							
130	130	133	301								Ayla	Don't you think the piper is too lonely if she has to go on that journey alone?	1																					
131	131		204							1	19																							
132	132		301								Ayla	...I think so too.	1																					
133	133		301								Ayla	...But at least she survived. Well, everyone survived.	1																					
134	134		302								Yeah.	135	There is always hope so long as we live.	135																				
135	135		301									Ayla lets out a sigh. She keeps her emotional feelings under control and changes to another subject.																						
136	136		204							1	4																							
137	137		301								Ayla	We have triggered three endings so far... but I don't think this will be the last one.	1																					
138	138		302								I think it is the last one.	139	I agree with you.	141																				
139	139		301								Ayla	Do you think these are all the messages Selena left behind...? Are we not... missing anything else?	1																					
140	140		302								The sailor in the story mentioned a traveler.	143																						
141	141		301								Ayla	Why?	1																					
142	142		302								I think the story is missing something.	143	Tell her about the details that trouble you.	143																				
143	143		301								Ayla	Do you mean the traveler with purple eyes?	1																					
144	144		302								I think she is the same person as the piper.	145																						
145	145		301								Ayla	...Perhaps all these characters are trying to tell us Selena decided to become the piper because of the journey.	1

156	156		302								"Siren's call"?	157																						
157	157		301								Wanshi	Documents leftover from the Golden Age say that sirens were monsters that lived in the ocean who lured sailors with songs.	1																					
158	158		301								Wanshi	Sailors would become entranced by their songs and crash their ships into the reefs.	1																					
159	159		301								Wanshi	It's not difficult to understand why it's garnered such a negative reputation. After all, the sound and Red Tide coincide with death.	1

161	161		301								Wanshi	...It is. It's bound to the Red Tide, so we can always rely on the sound to predict the rise and fall of the Red Tide.	1
