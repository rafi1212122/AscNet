3	3		301			DialogEnable						The witch doesn't always become friends with the princess in every story.																						
4	4		301									That is especially true at the beginning of a story, where the witch and the princess are still young.																						
5	5		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The little witch wears a big cloak and a big hat. The adult witch tells her to always sneak around and never take off her hat or her cloak while she is in a great hall. She will have more respect from others if they mistake her for a midget or a dwarf.

7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						So, by the time she has passed through the maze-like hallways and the red palace to arrive at the magnificent council chamber with the adult witch, the little witch's legs are already trembling.																						
8	8		301									She sees the king sitting on his adorned throne. As he opens his mouth and speaks, the little witch doesn't understand what he says except that he wants the adult witch to give her blessing to the little princess.																						
9	9		301									The little princess is fourteen years old, only a little older than the little witch.																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The little witch remembers. The adult witch once told her that a witch must never let another person know her age. Yes, she needs to keep this information a secret.																						
11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The king goes on and on. Bored, the little witch draws strange patterns with her magic on the red carpet in the palace. At last, the king raises his hand and invites the two witches to another room to continue their conversation. Nearly losing her balance, she almost trips and falls on her face.																						
12	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The little witch thinks it's a pity that she didn't fall to the floor. So, she tries to cast a thousand shapeshifting magic and eventually sneaks away, leaving only her cloak and hat in place like a scarecrow to keep the birds away.

14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The girl hides in the shadow of a lantern hanging high up in the air. Slowly, she wanders around this maze-like castle. There are many things here that cannot be found in the forest. They are big, tall, and square, beautiful but without a soul.																						
15	15		301									The little witch steps on the shadow of guards and servants to go outside. She doesn't dare stray too far because she doesn't know when the witch and the king will finish their conversation. But she doesn't want to stay close to the center of that palace either because that place is devoid of souls.																						
16	16		301									Many people grow their physical bodies while their souls shrink.																						
17	17		301									She searches for the light of souls. As she looks in the direction of the courtyard, she discovers the light and pleasant smells of souls all come from a few puppet dolls.																						
18	18		301									The puppet dolls mumble and walk. Fascinated, the little witch looks at them for a long while until she finally realizes there is a pair of small hands hidden behind the dolls to manipulate them.																						
19	19		201							1	500433	1																						
20	20		301							1		The light of souls comes from this person, who is small, soft, and about the same age as she is.																						
21	21		301									This beautiful girl has a pair of purple eyes as beautiful as gems. And there are many strange, funny stories in her head.																						
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									They talk about the stars in the sky, the ocean they have never seen, the forest where the little witch lives, and the little secrets of that castle. They talk about everything.																						
24	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She knows she is the princess, and the princess knows she is a witch. They continue to talk about more things. The princess manipulates her puppet dolls to talk, and the witch brings those dolls to life. Together, they start a show in this little courtyard.																						
25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						For many days after that, the little witch always sneaks out to the same courtyard. No one knows the little witch and the little princess have become friends.
