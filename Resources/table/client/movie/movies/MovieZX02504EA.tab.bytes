6	6		301								Simpie	Are you willing to listen?	2																					
7	7		301								Pulao	Of course. We don't even know each other. There must be a reason behind this.	1																					
8	8		204							1																								
9	9		301								Pulao	The last thing I want is to bring others trouble without realizing it.	1																					
10	10		301								Simpie	Okay...	2																					
11	11		301								Simpie	I can't stop you going for the Big Fish by force anyway.	2																					
12	12		301									Simpie looks at Pulao's gigantic sword and gulps.																						
13	13		301								Simpie	The search for Big Fish will only bring misfortune to everyone around you. You must not do it.	2																					
14	14		202							1	2				1																			
15	15		301									Simpie takes out a half-empty pack of cigarettes. The surface of the paper case has yellowed with age, but is still very clean. When looking closely, Pulao sees an old photo attached inside the case. In the photo are Simpie and another woman whose face can hardly be recognized.																						
16	16		301									He lights up one cigarette and inhales with a lot of power and sentiment.																						
17	17		301									When the smoke disappears in the air, Simpie takes a deep sigh.

25	25		301								Simpie	Back then, I was young, weak, and always bullied at school.	2																					
26	26		301								Simpie	One day, when the gangsters blackmailed me again, Mei save me. She drove away the bullies and gave me her handkerchief to clean my wounds.	2																					
27	27		301								Simpie	I saw her smile sparkling in the sun. It must be what love felt like, I thought.	2

38	38		301							1	Simpie	I had been watching her in secret ever since. In the morning, I would put her favorite snack inside her desk. Before her cleaning duty session, I would help her to finish all the work. During exams, I would "carelessly" show her my complete answers...	2																					
39	39		301								Pulao	Um, did she really need that?	1																					
40	40		301								Simpie	It doesn't matter. What matters is that I must do everything I could to show my love.	2																					
41	41		301								Simpie	She was so beautiful, like a sun that warmed me up with everything she said or did.	2																					
42	42		301									Simpie curls his arm to showcase his strong biceps.																						
43	43		301								Simpie	I trained hard so I could protect her.	2																					
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Simpie	We had a lot of interactions back then. Everything felt so happy until the cursed Big Fish stepped into our life, bringing misfortune to everybody.	2

51	51		301								Mei	Really? Anything?																						
52	52		301								Simpie	Of course!	1																					
53	53		301								Mei	I heard there was this Big Fish in the east. His tears are incredibly precious...

57	57		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Simpie	Storm, landslide, stranded in the wilderness, hunger... I went through many obstacles and finally found the Big Fish. But it was all too late when I finally returned with his tear.	1																					
58	58		301								Simpie	Mei's house was empty. Her neighbors said she married one of the guys who used to bully me and moved to another city.	1																					
59	59		301								Simpie	No matter what I sent, she never replied again.	1

66	66		301								Pulao	But it has nothing to do with Mr. Big Fish, I'm afraid?	1																					
67	67		301								Simpie	How can you say that? If I didn't look for that Big Fish, maybe I wouldn't lose my love.	2																					
68	68		204							1																								
69	69		301								Simpie	It's all the Big Fish's fault. Without Mei, my life was a mess.	2																					
70	70		301								Simpie	I finally learned this after getting drunk many times.	2																					
71	71		301								Simpie	You must, not, look for the Big Fish.	2																					
72	72		301								Simpie	It will bring misfortune.	2																					
73	73		301								Pulao	But aren't you just lying to yourself?	1																					
74	74		301								Simpie	?	2																					
75	75		301								Pulao	Because your eyelid is twitching a lot when you mention the Big Fish. It seems that you're very nervous and trying to hide the truth.	1

90	90		301							1	Pulao	You are only running away from the truth. You blame it on something else so you can feel better.	1																					
91	91		301								Simpie	Love is a complicated thing. What can you possibly understand, little girl?	2																					
92	92		301								Pulao	I'm young, and I have never dated anyone. But I think what you had was not a healthy relationship.	1																					
93	93		301								Pulao	What I learned from many people's experiences was that love should be mutual instead of one-sided giving like what you did.	1																					
94	94		301								Simpie	Impossible! I could feel my heart pounding when I did those things for her. If it wasn't love, what could it be? All those feelings... The song I played in the rain on her birthday night, the pack of cigarettes that she left me. What are they?	2																					
95	95		301								Pulao	Could it be that you were just doing those things to make yourself feel better?	1																					
96	96		301								Simpie	You! I...	2

103	103		301							1	Pulao	I guess that's why onlookers can see most of the game.	1																					
104	104		301								Pulao	Uncle Birdie and others must have figured it out long ago. They never told you because they didn't want to hurt you.	1

118	118		301								Pulao	Mei had left long ago, but these friends have been staying with you all along. They couldn't tell you the truth because they didn't want to hurt you. Aren't they more important?	1																					
119	119		301								Simpie	No, Mei didn't do anything wrong. It was...	2

149	149		301								Birdie	Some may laugh at us, saying we can't get anywhere without friends.	2
