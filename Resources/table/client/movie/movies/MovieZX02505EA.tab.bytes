7	7		301							1	Pulao	You're here too!	2																					
8	8		301									As Pulao walks off the stage, she sees the old man selling her the prune drink earlier in the day. His eyes are half-closed, gazing at the city in the night.																						
9	9		301								Old Man	See, these are our people. This is our city, prosperous like a dream. If we can't capture the passion and emotions, they will disappear in the very next moment.	1																					
10	10		301								Old Man	They really like you.	1																					
11	11		204							2																								
12	12		301								Pulao	Huh...? Really?	2																					
13	13		301								Old Man	Yeah. Have you thought about living here after everything?	1																					
14	14		301								Old Man	Life here is neither too busy nor too slow. There are little troubles occasionally, but soon they will be resolved. There won't be too many changes, so you won't be disappointed. A little surprise could bring about a celebration, just like your arrival.	1																					
15	15		204							2	6																							
16	16		301								Pulao	Honestly, I don't even know what to do myself.	2																					
17	17		301								Old Man	That's okay. You have a long way to go, and you have a lot of time to think.	1																					
18	18		301								Old Man	I heard you were going to the dock in the early morning. Rest early.	1																					
19	19		202							1	2				1																			
20	20		301									The old man takes out his rattle drum and steps into the night, humming some melodies. Pulao can still hear his voice echoing in the summer night after he disappears at the end of the alley.																						
21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Old Man	You gave us all a sweet dream. Thank you.	1

27	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						————																						
28	28		301									It is a drowsy morning. Pulao wakes up in a soft place.																						
29	29		301									The familiar room somehow has lost all its colors. Only black and white remain.																						
30	30		301									Strangely, Pulao does not feel unusual but has naturally accepted everything.																						
31	31		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A few silhouettes—who appear to be Simpie and his friends—are already waiting outside. Pulao smiles and greets them, then boards the earliest ship.																						
32	32		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory552.jpg																								
33	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Just like Simpie said, it didn't take long for Pulao to reach the destination. It feels like she has only taken one step to get to the end of the road.																						
34	34		301									In front of her is a turbulent but silent blue ocean.																						
35	35		301									She puts down her backpack and looks around, shouting to the sky with her hands around her mouth.																						
36	36		201							1	500445																							
37	37		301							1	Pulao	Mr. Big Fish— Where are you—	1																					
38	38		301									Where are you—																						
39	39		301									She can only hear cold echoes.																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Pulao is anxious but cannot do anything. Unable to find the Big Fish, she can only return to the town, awaiting the next ship out.																						
42	42		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Simpie and his friends give her a warm welcome. They even put up another carnival.																						
44	44		301									She finds nothing on her second voyage.																						
45	45		301									The old man helps Pulao to find a dwelling in town. She is prepared for many more trips.																						
46	46		301									She finds nothing on her third voyage.																						
47	47		301									The fourth, fifth... Pulao has lost track of how many times she has failed.																						
48	48		301									All her effort only result in disappointment.																						
49	49		301									Waking up, getting on the ship, looking for the Big Fish and coming back with no luck. These repetitious daily routines have almost taken up Pulao's entire life.																						
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					This invariable cycle is slowly eroding her resolution and passion.																						
51	51		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory236.png																								
52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Pulao has also tried some folk remedies to heal Master, or gone somewhere else to look for the Big Fish. But no matter what she does, she cannot find a second solution to save Master's life.																						
53	53		301									What if she still cannot find the Big Fish's tear tomorrow? What will happen to Master?																						
54	54		301									Every night, Pulao can only fall asleep with worry and anxiety. Still, she holds onto the hope that one day a miracle will happen.																						
55	55		301									Pulao has lost track of how much time has passed. One night, she has a dream.																						
56	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					In her dream she finally finds the Big Fish.																						
57	57		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory552.jpg																								
58	58		201							1	500445	2																						
59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Pulao	Mr. Big Fish! I've finally found you.	1																					
60	60		204							1	1																							
61	61		301								Pulao	Can I get some tears please? I need it to save a life.	1																					
62	62		201							1	500459																							
63	63		301							1	Big Fish	...	1																					
64	64		301									But Big Fish doesn't reply.																						
65	65		201							1	500445																							
66	66		301							1	Pulao	Mr. Big Fish, where are you going? Mr. Big Fish!	1																					
67	67		301									Big Fish never responds but moves further away. No matter how Pulao tries to catch up, she cannot stop him from leaving.																						
68	68		301								Pulao	What am I going to do without you... Master will...	1																					
69	69		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Big Fish never replies in the end. Pulao feels her body getting lighter and lighter.																						
70	70		202							1	2				1																			
71	71		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2501_03.jpg																								
72	72		401							1	63																							
73	73		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Big Fish, the dock, the town, and even the soil under her feet are drawing away.																						
74	74		301									After that, everything disappears. Only the sounds of whales can be heard instead.																						
75	75		301								Pulao	Big... Fish...?																						
76	76		301								Pulao	No, they aren't.																						
77	77		301									The whales approach Pulao, overwhelming her world.																						
78	78		301									Thus, her story has come to an end.

85	85		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Pulao	AHHHHHHHHHH!!!	1																					
86	86		301									Pulao wakes up in the hotel and immediately checks the time on her terminal. She lets out a sigh of relief after confirming the celebration only took place last night.																						
87	87		301								Pulao	Phew... Thank Goodness, it was just a dream.	1

93	93		201							2	500084		400																					
94	94		301							1	Birdie	Good, we need to go now. The first ship is about to set sail.	2																					
95	95		301								Pulao	Alright. I'll be there in a second!	1																					
96	96		301									Pulao replies loudly and pats at her own chest.																						
97	97		301								Pulao	It's okay. Don't worry. It was all just a dream.	1																					
98	98		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	I will find you, Mr. Big Fish!	1
