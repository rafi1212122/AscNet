101	101		301							1	Snowball	There have been fewer and fewer humans on the surface ever since the moment it suddenly started snowing. I never saw one again, so I had to leave the park to find another place that would need me...	1

126	126		301								Snowball	This is our leisure area, where humans can relax and rest.	2																					
127	127		301								Snowball	This is the play area for human children. We thought that if humans visited, they might bring children with them.	2

133	133		301								Snowball	We built this "bonfire" to keep humans warm. We believed humans were gone seeking warmer places because of how cold this place became. As long as we guard this neighborhood, humans will find us and move in.	2

135	135		301								Martini	Please try our food, esteemed guests.																						
136	136		301								Snowball	We are not sure how they taste since none of us have tastebuds... Perhaps you can offer some suggestions, Madam.	2																					
137	137		301									Before Snowball can finish, Nanami has already grabbed the cake from the tray and stuffed it into her mouth.

230	230		301									The wind seems to be stronger at night, pulling more snow into the "neighborhood." Whirling inside the dome, it almost sounds like it is wailing.

234	234		301							1	Nanami	Nothing. It's just... the wind sounds like it's crying.	1																					
235	235		204							1	2																							
236	236		301									Longingly, Nanami places her hand on the building's wall as if feeling something.																						
237	237		301								Nanami	...	1																					
238	238		204							1	1																							
239	239		301								Nanami	Snipey, once we've found your maker, Commandant, and the others, we'll tell all of them about this neighborhood!	1																					
240	240		301								Nanami	Then, this will truly become a happy place.	1																					
241	241		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
242	242		301							1	Sniper	What is a "Commandant"?	1																					
243	243		301								Sniper	And were you not happy?	1																					
244	244		202							1					1																			
245	245		301									Sniper-PK43 is surprised to hear what he said. He does not understand what "happiness" is, but he unintentionally interprets Nanami's behavior as a human.																						
246	246		301									Nanami smiles.																						
247	247		201							1	500472	1																						
248	248		301							1	Nanami	It's because I saw how everyone still remains hopeful, and that hope, in return, continues to push them forward. That's why I'm happy!	1																					
249	249		301									She waves, and the mech waiting outside the dome seems to feel her longing and walks toward her.

255	255		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Miles away from the neighborhood, Nanami and Sniper-PK43 look down as they—technically, just Nanami—lie on a plateau. They can still see the bright and empty city in the distance as if it is the only star in the silent night.																						
256	256		401							1	120																							
257	257		301									Nanami raises her hand to block away the snow falling on her face. Through the gap between her fingers, she looks at the lonely neighborhood.																						
258	258		201							1	500472																							
259	259		301							1	Nanami	Do you like it there, Snipey?	1																					
260	260		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
261	261		301							1	Sniper	...Are you referring to that community? It does not mean anything in particular to me.	1																					
262	262		202							1					1																			
263	263		301									Eventually, Nanami puts down her sore arm and blinks, staring at the flashing phantoms the bright stars left in her eyes.																						
264	264		201							1	500472																							
265	265		301							1	Nanami	For a second, Nanami doesn't know where she is...	1																					
266	266		301									She flips over on the ground and extends her arms, burying her face in the snow as if she is embracing the earth.																						
267	267		301								Nanami	Even though Nanami has always traveled alone since she left home, I never felt lonely.	1																					
268	268		204							1	14																							
269	269		301								Nanami	But now... for some reason...	1																					
270	270		301									She pats the ground gently, and the snow splashes onto Sniper-PK43.

272	272		301								Nanami	Alright, alright... Please stop being upset if you're mad, granny earth...	1

274	274		301							1	Sniper	Are you trying to comfort earth for real?	1																					
275	275		301									The girl, with her head in the snow, replies, but her words are all muffled.																						
276	276		301								Sniper	Although my database is not updated, I know that... Earth is strong. Stronger than any human or mechanoid.	1																					
277	277		301									As he speaks, his motion sensor captures a strangely-shaped red deer dashing through the night. Creatures other than humans seem to have started to adapt to the environment.																						
278	278		301									Sniper-PK43 cannot help but wonder.																						
279	279		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Are there... still humans on this planet?
