19	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Now, she seems to have lost the grace Nanami remembers. Her torn cloak flies in the freezing wind, her body dotted with battle scars with oil-stained bandages loosely wrapped around the exposed parts.

28	28		301							1	Nanami	Nanami doesn't know... Haicma, why is there a war? Why are the Constructs attacking us... What happened here?	2																					
29	29		204							1	4																							
30	30		301									Hearing that, Haicma's expression turns serious. She may be tired and injured, but the resolve in her eyes has never wavered.																						
31	31		301								Haicma	I don't know why you suddenly lost all your memories... but "Mother" has asked me to guide you by your side if you are ever lost.	1																					
32	32		301								Haicma	I will try to give you a concise explanation.	1																					
33	33		301								Haicma	As the Sagemachina, you joined the Church of Machina, which grew under your teachings. But it eventually split into two factions.	1																					
34	34		301								Haicma	The other faction, led by "Lover", pursued the meaning of war. Humanity dwindles, facing the threats from both the Punishing Virus and the Church of Machina, and humans are on the brink of extinction.	1																					
35	35		204							2	7																							
36	36		301								Nanami	...	2																					
37	37		301									Feeling dazed, Nanami looks around her. The metal from the broken machines clatters in the wind. This was part of the battlefield—she has seen it with her own eyes now. She tried, and this is the future Gestalt offers.																						
38	38		204							2	4																							
39	39		301								Nanami	Who is "Mother"?	2																					
40	40		301								Haicma	Her name is Alucard. She has always been the head of the Church of Machina, running the Church before you showed up.	1																					
41	41		301								Nanami	I see...	2																					
42	42		301									Just this brief glimpse is enough to make Nanami reject this frightening future with all her heart.																						
43	43		301									Still, just like last time... Nanami must understand every cause behind the scene to avoid this future.																						
44	44		301								Nanami	Nanami believes you, Haicma.	2																					
45	45		301								Haicma	I've always believed you as well, Sage.	1																					
46	46		204							2	14																							
47	47		301								Nanami	Based on what you said... Nanami would like to stop this war. This is not how the world should look like.	2																					
48	48		301								Haicma	You never agreed with the war. Whatever you decide to do, I will stand by your side and help you.	1																					
49	49		301									Haicma says the same words she said in the other future.																						
50	50		301								Haicma	I'm not your only friend here, but humanity's aggression is not the only thing you have to defeat.	1																					
51	51		301								Haicma	If you want to stop the war, we've got to get going.	1																					
52	52		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Haicma extends her arm and points. Following that direction, an iron tower stands on the horizon.

58	58		301								Haicma	That's the headquarters of the Church of Machina... the "Sanctuary".																						
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Haicma	At the "Sanctuary", you'll find more machines that are willing to pledge their loyalty to you... They're currently devising a final battle that will end the war between humankind and machines.

66	66		301								Nanami	...Okay!	2																					
67	67		301								Haicma	I'd like to assure you about one thing, though.	1																					
68	68		301									The white-haired mechanoid reaches out to Nanami.																						
69	69		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Haicma	I have always been and will always be your partner, your follower, and your comrade.	1
