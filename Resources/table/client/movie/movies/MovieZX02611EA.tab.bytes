4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Nanami	It's okay now. I will set you free!	1																					
5	5		301									Nanami runs to a bed and unties the human from it. She wants to disconnect him from the entangled tubes, but there is no place to start with.																						
6	6		202							1					1																			
7	7		301								Human	No...																						
8	8		301									God only knows when he last spoke. Squeezing voices out of his mouth, the man grabs Nanami by the wrist with his twig-like fingers.																						
9	9		301									Nanami moves her ear close, trying to figure out what he is saying.																						
10	10		301								Human	Let... me... go...																						
11	11		201							1	500472	14																						
12	12		301							1	Nanami	...	1																					
13	13		201							1	500477	4																						
14	14		301							1	Haicma	Nanami, look at him...	1																					
15	15		202							1					1																			
16	16		301									Haicma pulls up the man's blanket, revealing his legs.																						
17	17		301									They can hardly be called "legs", more like a pair of dead wood branches wrapped in wrinkly paper. 																						
18	18		301									Everyone else here probably has met the same fate. They are drained of every last bit of desire for life even if they are broken free of their straitjackets.																						
19	19		301								Human	Please... Let me die.																						
20	20		301									The human's eager eyes almost burn Nanami. She steps back and shakes her head in hesitation.																						
21	21		201							1	500472	14																						
22	22		301							1	Nanami	No... I came... to save you...	1																					
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301								Human	Please...																						
25	25		301									His hollowed eyes flooded with despair, the man is now awake with numbness and pain. These people want to be set free from their suffering. Clinging to his last hope, the man implores with what little energy he has left.																						
26	26		301									The silent beast mechanoid takes a sigh behind her.																						
27	27		301								Spuner	Sage, he's asking to be put out of his misery of his own volition.																						
28	28		301									Nanami lowers her head. She grabs the cold hand on her arm.																						
29	29		301								Spuner	Please let me do it.																						
30	30		301									The beast walks forward, leaving a large, dark shadow on the bed, resembling the beast of death and burial in ancient myths.																						
31	31		201							1	500472	14																						
32	32		301							1	Nanami	Wait!	1																					
33	33		301									Nanami grabs Spooner by the arm as she asks the human one last question.																						
34	34		301								Nanami	...What is your name?	1																					
35	35		301								Max	...M-Max...																						
36	36		301								Nanami	Okay... Max. I won't forget you.	1																					
37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		301									Rubbing her face, Nanami nods at her new friend.																						
39	39		301									The jet-black beast mechanoid holds up its hand, its claws flashing in the cold light.																						
40	40		301									A cheerful melody comes from his fingertips. Not played for ages, the audio is a little distorted in the beginning, but gets clear over time.																						
41	41		301									Following the melody, the small projector on Spooner's chest shows blurry pictures of people laughing and fireworks going off—a scene from some distant dream.																						
42	42		301									The final color in the human's eyes can be described as "warm", as if he has seen a kaleidoscopic voyage taking him to the future.																						
43	43		301									Spooner rubs its hand gently against the man's cold cheek as it rasps. Then, as the man's body slowly twitches to a stop, Spooner knows that the man's soul has been set free from his filthy bed and endless suffering.																						
44	44		301									He slowly raises his arm and shuts down the flickering switches on the human's life-support system. 																						
45	45		301								Spuner	...Bon voyage.																						
46	46		301									With the melody still playing, Nanami moves down to the next bed behind Spooner.																						
47	47		201							1	500472	14																						
48	48		301							1	Nanami	What's your name?	1																					
49	49		301								Nanami	...Okay. Nanami will remember...	1																					
50	50		301									Then on she goes, bearing witness to these humans' last moment as a friend who knows their names while Spooner stops their suffering.																						
51	51		301									Some of the humans never regained their consciousness. Placing his hand over their chests and giving them his best wishes, Spooner sees them off in their dreams.																						
52	52		301									The "journey" quickly comes to an end.																						
53	53		301									In the end, Nanami just stands in the corner as she hears the last heart beat disappear, leaving behind a deadly silence.																						
54	54		301								Nanami	And you...	1																					
55	55		301									Nanami crouches down. With her eyes closed, she is feeling the "emotions" of the fallen medic bots.																						
56	56		301									When Nanami opens her eyes again, they are no longer occupied by sorrow. Instead, they are burning with rage.																						
57	57		204							1	4																							
58	58		301							1	Nanami	Haicma, Spooner.	1																					
59	59		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	...Let's head down to the "terminal."	1
