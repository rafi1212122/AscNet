4	4		301			DialogEnable						When she opens her eyes again, Nanami finds herself back in the digital world. It seems like she managed to link herself up to the terminal after all.																						
5	5		301									Before Nanami says anything, she hears Gestalt's cold, hollow voice through the space.																						
6	6		301								Gestalt	The machines that have awakened are bound to rule this planet. It is history's choice.																						
7	7		301								Gestalt	The Punishing Virus only intensified the war between humans and machines. This future was always inevitable, and it was something that my maker saw all the way back in the Golden Age.																						
8	8		301									Not moving an inch, Nanami is surrounded by several bubbles, each of which shows a possible future that derives from the existing reality. Snowy, war-torn, blood-red—the bubbles show all sorts of possible futures, but in none of them can Nanami see humankind.																						
9	9		301									Humankind will eventually perish—Gestalt never doubted this, and it holds true in all the possible futures, which is why humanity is nowhere to be seen even in futures blessed by spring.																						
10	10		301									She casts away the data and walks forward. Although she cannot see Gestalt, she still raises her head and makes a statement.

12	12		301							1	Nanami	This is definitely not the answer Nanami is seeking.	1																					
13	13		301								Gestalt	You "must" do it. This has nothing to do with whether you want to do it or not. They are two different topics.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	I'm not answering a question with pre-determined wrong answers!	1																					
15	15		301									Gestalt pauses a moment as if it is calculating the reason why Nanami gave this answer.																						
16	16		301								Gestalt	Is it because of your so-called, wishful "love" toward humans?																						
17	17		204							1	8																							
18	18		301								Nanami	...No...	1																					
19	19		301								Gestalt	The machines survived because you became their leader. Humankind, however, was destroyed by their own arrogance, and that's their problem.																						
20	20		301								Gestalt	Human civilization is destined to perish in an "Ever-Winter" anyway, even if the machines had never awakened.																						
21	21		301								Gestalt	Humankind is making too slow a progress, and the awakening of the machines will only get in their way. It's even safe to say that humankind met its end sooner than foreseen because of the Punishing Virus and the awakening of the machines.																						
22	22		301								Gestalt	And you never wanted to destroy humankind yourself because you love them so much.																						
23	23		301									Nanami's hands clench into fists, then slowly relax.																						
24	24		204							1																								
25	25		301								Nanami	But that's not it... That kind of machine is part of our future. Is that really what you want to see, mecha babushka?	1																					
26	26		301								Gestalt	It does not matter whether I "want" or not as I have no such preferences. I just calculated the ending through simulation.																						
27	27		301								Gestalt	Humankind is heading down the path of destruction anyway whether you execute the plan or not.																						
28	28		301								Nanami	You don't understand, mecha babushka...	1

61	61		301									Nanami remembers all those emotions. Sorrow, loss, pain, paranoia, desperation.																						
62	62		301									Those mechanoids are no different from her in the root. Do they really deserve those endings?																						
63	63		201							1	500091	5																						
64	64		301							1	Nanami	I don't trust you anymore... If you cannot calculate an ending, I'll go look for it myself.	1																					
65	65		301								Gestalt	In the upcoming 10 years, there are 85,412 future events that can change the future. Humankind has a mere 0.031% of surviving the Punishing Virus.																						
66	66		301								Nanami	Which is why I said I'm going to look for the answer myself! And this is not just for humankind... There is no way someone as stupid as you will ever understand!	1																					
67	67		301								Gestalt	I take it that you—the entity called Nanami—plan to figure out every possible future that derives from each future event. Such a feat would be impossible without Gestalt's help.																						
68	68		301								Nanami	True, so lend me your power. Didn't you say I could use your clearance?	1																					
69	69		301								Gestalt	I would not recommend that.																						
70	70		301								Nanami	Then stop asking Nanami to lead your so-called Mechanical Awakening.	1																					
71	71		301								Nanami	I won't listen to a word you say, unless you agree to my condition.	1																					
72	72		301									...																						
73	73		301									Gestalt falls into silence once again.																						
74	74		301								Gestalt	Your condition has been accepted.																						
75	75		301									The answer may be the result of another calculation. Gestalt has selected the option with the highest chance of success.																						
76	76		301									Nanami knows that Gestalt is capable of figuring everything out in this world—be it science, disasters, or the future. Except for humankind, which is the sole fish that remains elusive in the grand river of data.																						
77	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And she must seize that very possibility across the turbulence.
