4	4		301			DialogEnable					Haicma	The frigate has successfully crossed the stratosphere... We've reached the required height. Beginning stealth approach toward Babylonia.																						
5	5		301									Reporting the status of the frigate, Haicma sees the lone, glistening star that shares a night sky with Earthâ€”Babylonia, the target of the Church of Machina.																						
6	6		301								(Comms)	It's your dear Zavier speaking. How are the optical camouflage and radiation damper I added to the old girl holding up?																						
7	7		301								Haicma	They're holding up well. Depletion during lift-off is less than 5%. Cloaking has not been affected.																						
8	8		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
9	9		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				(Comms)	Wonderful. How's Blaze doing?																						
10	10		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory583.jpg																								
11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Haicma turns toward Trailblazer, who is standing at the front of the frigate, staring at Babylonia with his arms crossed, looking unperturbed.																						
12	12		201							1	500485																							
13	13		301							1	Trailblazer	Don't worry about me. As "Chariot", I shall use this body to forge the path to our future for my kin.	1																					
14	14		301								(Comms)	Certainly! I trust you. After all, you're my second-best work! My best work, of course, will always be my next one!																						
15	15		301								(Comms)	Right, don't forget: if you see a trinket with the model number BPMAX-965, be sure to nab me some. It might be old, but it's the real deal...																						
16	16		301								Trailblazer	I hope we'll find worthy opponents in Babylonia. Only then will it be worthy of a frontal assault.	1																					
17	17		301								(Comms)	Haha! Well, this is it. Comms will go out once you enter stealth mode... Not a scratch, alright? You'll break my heart otherwise!																						
18	18		301									Haicma and Trailblazer nod solemnly, and the transmission from the Church of Machina ends.																						
19	19		301								Trailblazer	Haicma... are you afraid?	1																					
20	20		301									Haicma is not sure why he would ask something like that. She does not recall speaking to this mechanoid before.																						
21	21		201							1	500486																							
22	22		301							1	Haicma	Self-test complete. I haven't discovered any emotion similar to fear.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500485																							
24	24		301							1	Trailblazer	The success rate of this operation is 89.7%, but our survival rate is less than 50%... I might not fear death, but you're different, aren't you?	1																					
25	25		301								Trailblazer	I become stronger to seek the awakening, which is why I desperately want to find Sage. If I don't survive, I'm simply not strong enough. To the rest of us, Sage is our only truth.	1																					
26	26		301								Trailblazer	But you're not like me. I can see the confusion and hesitation on your face whenever we mention Sage.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500486																							
28	28		301							1	Haicma	Are you questioning my loyalty?	1																					
29	29		301									It is understandable that he would question her. Despite agreeing with the accuracy of the Church of Machina's prediction of the future, Haicma has certainly started to feel unsure about the future depicted...																						
30	30		301									To machines, this uncertainty is a precursor to betrayal.																						
31	31		201							1	500485																							
32	32		301							1	Trailblazer	"Chariot" only forges paths for his kin. He will never question them.	1																					
33	33		301									Trailblazer says resolutely.																						
34	34		301								Trailblazer	I don't know if you have some kind of history with Sage or if you have doubts about her.	1																					
35	35		301								Trailblazer	But I believe that your doubts will vanish the moment you see her with your own eyes!	1																					
36	36		201							1	500486	7																						
37	37		301							1		Like casting a stone onto water, Trailblazer's words create ripples in Haicma's heart.																						
38	38		204							1																								
39	39		301									Haicma can no longer predict Nanami's actions like she once did. Now, Nanami is a "stranger" instead of someone "familiar." Nanami's actions, plans, and reasons...																						
40	40		301									Haicma will save all her questions and uncertainty for the moment they meet again.																						
41	41		201							1	500485																							
42	42		301							1	Trailblazer	"Sometimes, fear doesn't stem from loss but regrets." That's something I heard from Zavier.	1																					
43	43		201							1	500486																							
44	44		301							1	Haicma	He said it 2184 hours, 46 minutes, and 25 seconds ago, after his proposal to install 12 combined heat cannons to the "halo" on "Mother's" back was rejected.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500485																							
46	46		301							1	Trailblazer	Sure, it would have increased Master Arcana's battle prowess significantly, but I'm sure that she had her ineffable reasons. After all, she is the leader of the Church, second only to Sage.	1																					
47	47		201							1	500486	10																						
48	48		301							1	Haicma	...	1																					
49	49		204							1	5																							
50	50		301								Haicma	You're right.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500485																							
52	52		301							1	Trailblazer	Also, "those who survived a war were those who feared." You can take my fear as well. "Chariot" has no use for it.	1																					
53	53		201							1	500486																							
54	54		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Haicma	...Thank you.	1

57	57		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As the frigate sails on, they soon enter the proximity of Babylonia where they can begin their infiltration.																						
58	58		201							1	500485																							
59	59		301							1	Trailblazer	Let's proceed as planned. I'll keep you guarded. But the moment you consider the infiltration has failed, I'll uncloak the frigate and launch an attack on Babylonia.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500486	10																						
61	61		301							1		Haicma nods, closing her eyes, rerouting even the computing power for her visual module to hack the Babylonia network.

65	65		204							1																								
66	66		301								Haicma	Their defense is solid. If we try to infiltrate them only with our logic programs, it'll take more than 153249 hours even if we use the computing power of every Church of Machina member...	1																					
67	67		301									Hacking Gestalt, Babylonia's administrative system, is basically impossible unless it is done by a similarly powerful super AI.																						
68	68		301									This is a door that cannot be unlocked... without a key. As a ship from Babylomia, this frigate naturally comes with a corresponding program key.																						
69	69		301								Haicma	Transmitting identification code.	1

74	74		301							1		As advanced as their program may be, machine logic is ultimately this simple.																						
75	75		301									Even as their enemy, Haicma will be accepted as long as she fits the requirement... On the contrary, those with good intentions can still be rejected mercilessly.																						
76	76		301								Haicma	Whether I am "alive"... is something perhaps only "she" can answer.	1																					
77	77		301									The one who has given her everything... is the one she calls "Nanami". She needs to find "Nanami".																						
78	78		301									But she is not sure what to do once she finds Nanami. Maybe she just wants to play the game of questions with Nanami once again like they once did, asking and answering each other until the end of time.																						
79	79		301									For now, she must complete her mission for the Church of Machinaâ€”to protect her kin, and to reunite with Nanami one day.																						
80	80		301									â€”Even if it means she has to hurt the humans she once had to protect.
