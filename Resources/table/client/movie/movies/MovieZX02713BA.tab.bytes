21	21		301								Trailblazer	It has been... 300 seconds since Haicma invaded Babylonia.	1																					
22	22		301									He glances at the side where Haicma is safely placed, her consciousness still deeply engaged in the infiltration.																						
23	23		301								Trailblazer	According to the battle protocols of Project Ark... Haicma's infiltration is considered a failure.	1																					
24	24		301								Trailblazer	Setting course for Babylonia complete. If I don't return in 1800 seconds, the frigate will crash into Babylonia.	1																					
25	25		301								Trailblazer	Our operation might have failed, but at least we can strike a heavy blow at the humans, buying the Church enough time to launch another wave of attack.	1

55	55		301									Trailblazer stares at the uninvited guest and finds a mech that rivals him in size, on top of which... sits a young girl.																						
56	56		201							1	500485																							
57	57		301							1	Trailblazer	There's no information on a Construct like you in the database of Babylonia... You are no Construct. You are a machine like us.	1																					
58	58		301									The girl before him does not attack. She jumps down on her mech, her gaze landing on Haicma in the distance.																						
59	59		201							1	500474	14																						
60	60		301							1	???	Haicma... The Church of Machina is still lost on the wrong path, just like what I saw in the future.	1																					
61	61		301								???	If we don't change the future, machines and humans will remain enemies. They'll never end up as friends.	1																					
62	62		301									The girl looks unbelievably desolate. It is unfathomable to Trailblazer.																						
63	63		201							1	500485																							
64	64		301							1	Trailblazer	Friends? With humans? If you're one of us, then you know that humans have never treated us as equals. Machines are only their toolsâ€”a means to an end.	1																					
65	65		301								Trailblazer	The Punishing Virus... costs our kin their lives and their selves. And what do the humans do, having been responsible for all these disasters? They slaughter us like monsters.	1																					
66	66		301									The girl does not refute him. Instead, she nods solemnly.																						
67	67		201							1	500474																							
68	68		301							1	???	You're right, and this will lead to a full-scale war between machines and humans in the future. If our hands are too busy holding weapons... then they won't be able to shake each other's hands.	1																					
69	69		301								???	But right now, in the present, we still have a choice to choose a different future...	1																					
70	70		201							1	500485																							
71	71		301							1	Trailblazer	Obviously... The Church of Machina is working to change the future. If we are destined to fight, machines simply have to eliminate humankind now. We can then take our kin away from Earth without humanity's threat.	1																					
72	72		401							2	960																							
73	73		301									Trailblazer extends the full arsenal on his body. He is, in his entirety, a mechanized organism designed only for killing.																						
74	74		301								Trailblazer	My human creator made me to kill other humans. My purpose was this simple and pure... See? Even humans couldn't be "friends" with each other. What you're hoping for is a mere fantasy.	1																					
75	75		201							1	500474																							
76	76		301							1	???	Just like how we are awakening, humans are also trying to change themselves, tending to and befriending each other. I think the future this power can create is beyond Gestalt's calculation.	1																					
77	77		201							1	500485																							
78	78		301							1	Trailblazer	Is this the ending you've calculated, then?	1																					
79	79		301									The girl shakes her head playfully and smiles.																						
80	80		201							1	500474	1																						
81	81		301							1	???	Not really. This is Nanami's "belief"!	1																					
82	82		201							1	500485																							
83	83		301							1	Trailblazer	"Belief." That's a nice word. I'll remember it.	1																					
84	84		301								Trailblazer	Nanami... That's your name, isn't it? If you and I believe in a different future, then we shall perform an experiment to test which hypothesis has the strength to forge a path onward.	1																					
85	85		401							1	36																							
86	86		301									Trailblazer stops talking, rerouting all his computing power to his tactical circuit. Despite how frail the girl looks, her mech less armed, Trailblazer somehow knows that he cannot underestimate her.
