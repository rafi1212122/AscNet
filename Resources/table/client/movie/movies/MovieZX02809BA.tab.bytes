3	3		301			DialogEnable						All her equipment is packed. The zero-point reactor has restarted. The Omega Weapons are entering production... The duty of the Engineering Force is complete, and it is time for Karenina and her team to leave the Moon.																						
4	4		301									Karenina takes a look at her workplace of the last month one last time. From an unknown site to the familiar space it is now, this place has been nothing but memorable.																						
5	5		201							1	500495	13																						
6	6		301							1	Teddy	What's wrong? Are you going to miss this place? What about requesting a transfer? I know a guy at the Union who can pull some strings.	1

8	8		201							2	500494	12	400																					
9	9		301							1	Karenina	You idiot... That's not it.	2																					
10	10		301									Karenina simply cannot fathom how the scientists from the Golden Age managed to design and build this zero-point reactor from scratch.																						
11	11		301									Even after all these years, this machine that carries humanity's dreams and hope is still equally moving. It might be a sentiment only engineers and makers hold.																						
12	12		301								Karenina	Hmph. One day, we will invent something even more impressive than zero-point energy!	2																					
13	13		301								Teddy	Ha... It's not even nighttime, and you're already dreaming.	1																					
14	14		204							1	1																							
15	15		301									Before she knows it, Teddy also turns her gaze toward the zero-point reactor Karenina is staring at and reveals an unmistakable smile.																						
16	16		301								Teddy	But I suppose something like the zero-point reactor can only be designed by those who can't tell dreams from reality.	1

19	19		301							1	Yarha	Indeed... Those past scientists are amazing, aren't they?	1																					
20	20		301									A new voice suddenly appears beside them, startling both Teddy and Karenina.																						
21	21		203							1	0.25	400																						
22	22		201							2	500495	5	-400																					
23	23		301							1	Teddy	Dude... No one knew you were here.	2																					
24	24		204							1	2																							
25	25		301								Yarha	Haha... That happens a lot...	1																					
26	26		301									Yarha coughs, hoping to lessen his embarrassment, but it does not work.																						
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Yarha	Actually, Kurono sent me to see you off... and make sure you haven't taken something you "shouldn't" take or left behind something you "shouldn't" leave behind.	1																					
29	29		201							2	500494	4	-400																					
30	30		301							1	Karenina	Hmph... How tactfully phrased.	2																					
31	31		301									This is the end of their partnership. No one can tell if they will become sworn enemies the next second.																						
32	32		301								Yarha	It wasn't up to me... Collins and the others returned to Babylonia after the new specialized frame was completed. I'm the only one left, so I have to play the bad guy.	1																					
33	33		201							2	500495	5	-400																					
34	34		301							1	Teddy	As you can tell, our captain has left nothing behind but a few words of bull****. Haven't you guys been monitoring us anyways?	2																					
35	35		204							1	2																							
36	36		301								Yarha	We... well, we have...	1																					
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		201							2	500361		-400																					
39	39		301							1		At that moment, a Kurono researcher appears and hands Yarha a report.																						
40	40		301							1	Researcher	The power of the reactor... is decreasing...	2																					
41	41		301									He suddenly notices Karenina and the rest of the Engineering Force standing nearby, and he turns to look at Yarha.																						
42	42		301								Yarha	Don't worry. It's going to take a few hours for the transport crafts to arrive. We can still be partners before that, right?	1																					
43	43		301									Yarha looks at Karenina and Teddy with such hopefulness in his eyes that it honestly feels hard to reject him.																						
44	44		202							2					1																			
45	45		201							1	500495																							
46	46		301							1	Teddy	Sorry, I'm exhausted... but I know a zero-point energy enthusiast who wouldn't mind helping.	1																					
47	47		301									Teddy pushes Karenina forward while leaning in a corner, refusing to move.																						
48	48		203							1	0.25	-400																						
49	49		201							2	500494	5	400																					
50	50		301							1	Karenina	**** you! Don't you make things up about me!	2																					
51	51		204							2	4																							
52	52		301								Karenina	But... if there really is something wrong with the reactor, it's going to impact the production of the Omega Weapon. I should go take a look.	2																					
53	53		201							1	500499	2	-400																					
54	54		301							1	Yarha	I know you'll help, Karenina.	1

57	57		201							1	500495	13																						
58	58		301							1		Teddy waves goodbye gleefully as Karenina leaves with Yarhaâ€”but she has an odd feeling for some reason.																						
59	59		204							1	14																							
60	60		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Teddy	I can't shake the feeling that... something bad is about to happen.	1
