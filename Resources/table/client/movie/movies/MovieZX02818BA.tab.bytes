8	8		301									Karenina keeps dodging the incoming gravitational waves and knocking the Corrupted away.																						
9	9		301									In less than an hour's time, the gravitational waves are affecting a smaller radius but with significantly greater intensity. Some of the buildings in the lunar base are already decomposed into large debris.																						
10	10		401							2	957																							
11	11		301			RImgBg1Shake						After another huge explosion, blazing blue light begins to emit from debris and dust.																						
12	12		301								Karenina	The zero-point engine... is right over there!	1																					
13	13		301									The spherical zero-point engine is engulfed in a gravity storm, sucking in all nearby debris, lunar soil and the limbs of Corrupted. The anti-gravity field slowly lifts the engine into the sky.																						
14	14		301								Karenina	All the gravitational waves are concentrating in the engine... I can't waste any more time here.	1																					
15	15		301									Karenina slams the Blast Hammer hard on the Moon's surface. She keeps boosting the pressure in the hammer's propulsion engine.																						
16	16		301									Estimating gravity... Trajectory simulation complete. Engine compression 100%... 120%!																						
17	17		301								Karenina	If I can't get there from the ground, I'll just go from above!	1

25	24		301									When the engine reaches peak power, Karenina pulls the trigger. The charged kinetic energy is immediately released, shattering the fragile moon rocks underneath and launching Karenina along with the hammer rapidly toward her destination.

30	29		301							1		The gravity control device in her frame and the Blast Hammer's propulsion allow Karenina to adjust her stance while airborne, nimbly avoiding the impact of gravitational waves.

33	32		203							1	0.14	-50																						
34	33		301									But she soon finds out that whenever she tries to approach the zero-point engine, the gravitational waves would be in her way as if they are directly aimed at her.																						
35	34		301								Karenina	How strange... I feel like the zero-point engine has its own consciousness. It is trying to push me away.	1																					
36	35		401						300	2	13015111

38	37		203							1	0.14																							
39	38		301									After dodging another round of dense gravitational waves, Karenina transforms the Blast Hammer into the cannon form and fires at the zero-point engine.

44	42		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
45	43		301									The engine immediately compresses the gravitational waves to neutralize her shot. This is definitely not a coincidence.																						
46	44		204							1	7																							
47	45		301								Karenina	It's impossible! How can the zero-point engine protect itself...? Unless...	1

49	47		401					500		2	11105405																							
50	48		301			RImgBg1Shake						Karenina keeps firing at the gravity storm around the zero-point engine. When she finally peels off the debris, she finds some pale matter entangled at the bottom of the engine and is continuously growing upward.																						
51	49		301									It is not lunar soil or shattered debris, but a creature that she has never seen.

57	55		202							1																								
58	56		301									Slightly distracted, Karenina is hit by gravitational waves and falls to the Moon's surface. Thanks to the low gravity, she has not suffered much damage.

66	64		301							1	Karenina	Cough... ****! What the **** was that...?	1																					
67	65		301									Karenina has never seen such a creepy scene. When the pale matter finally wraps the zero-point engine within, the gravity storm gradually calms down. Everything seems to have stopped.																						
68	66		204							1	7																							
69	67		301									All of a sudden, the zero-point engine on top starts to shake vigorously. The crack on its pale outer shell turns to Karenina and "stares" at her like a creature's eye.																						
70	68		204							1	5																							
71	69		401							2	11105405																							
72	72		301			RImgBg1Shake						Karenina's instinct tells her the "creature" is dangerous. Without thinking, she raises her cannon and fires at it.																						
73	73		301								Karenina	What the?!	1																					
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		301									The compressed graviton fired from her cannon is blocked by this peculiar piece of flesh—to be precise, by its newly grown "arm."																						
76	76		201							1	500505	1																						
77	77		301							1		Soon, the pale flesh quickly grows another arm, followed by two legs. It slowly gets up on its feet and grows into a creepy humanoid.																						
78	78		301								Pale Mutant	Gargh— Argh—!	1

83	83		301			RImgBg1Shake						It lets out a hysterical cry. Uncontrolled gravitational waves burst out, shattering everything around.																						
84	84		301									Karenina does not need to ask it to know that this creature is her enemy. It's an enemy to all humans!																						
85	85		301									It continues to drain the energy supplied to the zero-point engine and emits crimson Punishing Virus.																						
86	86		201							1	500494	7																						
87	87		301							1	Karenina	Is this freak a Hetero-Creature?	1																					
88	88		201							1	500505	1																						
89	89		301							1		The monster frenetically scratches itself. Blue "blood" full of zero-point energy flows out from its wounds, but the blue color soon fades and is replaced by crimson.																						
90	90		301									The lunar soil nearby is soaked with this crimson liquid—or the Red Tide, to be more precise.																						
91	91		301								Pale Mutant	Gargh—!	1																					
92	92		301									The wounds left by its claws soon heal themselves. The energy drained from the zero-point engine will repair its body endlessly.																						
93	93		301									This energy will become an infinite source of the Punishing Virus. Soon, the entire Moon will be covered in the crimson blood color.

101	101		301			DialogEnable						Like a morning star, a small light dot rises into the deep, silent sky from the back of the Earth, followed by the blazing Sun.																						
102	102		301									But when looking closer at it, the "star" is blinking at a certain rhythm.																						
103	103		201							1	500494	4																						
104	104		301							1	Karenina	Babylonia...!	1																					
105	105		301									The blinking navigation lights in Babylonia were once used for communicating with other orbiter spacecraft, but they are too outdated and are no longer in use.																						
106	106		301									Babylonia has no need to communicate with other orbiter spacecraft—with no other orbital spacecraft left, Babylonia is the only unit that watches the Earth from space.																						
107	107		301									Right now, the lights are operating once again for just one person. The message is for Karenina and Karenina alone.																						
108	108		301								Karenina	"The World Government... has decided..."	1																					
109	109		301									Karenina carefully reads the message conveyed in the signal. The decision of humanity awaits her.																						
110	110		301								Karenina	"...to acknowledge and approve... the Engineering Force's decision... Karenina..."	1																					
111	111		204							1	7																							
112	112		301									Her eyes widen as she gazes at the blinking light, still finding it difficult to believe.																						
113	113		301								Karenina	"...go ahead... and destroy the zero-point engine!"	1																					
114	114		301									The signals cannot convey complex instructions, but they are more than enough to give Karenina never-ending courage.																						
115	115		204							1	1																							
116	116		301									She looks up and sniffles to stop the tears, then turns around and gives the monster a fearless smile.																						
117	117		301								Karenina	Hey, did you hear that? You bloody Punishing monster...	1																					
118	118		204							1	4

120	120		402							690																								
121	121		401							2	1226																							
122	122		301									Karenina holds her Blast Hammer up and points it directly at the monster. The tail flames from its propulsion engine are burning strong.																						
123	123		301								Karenina	They... The humans... want me to crush you.	1																					
124	124		301									Even when standing alone in the dark universe, Karenina no longer feels any fear. She knows the will of the entire human race is twinkling behind her, and this undying will—																						
125	125		301									—will become a star... and a torch.																						
126	126		204							1	5																							
127	127		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	So... Just ******* die!	1
