6	6		301							1	Construct Soldier 1	What happened? Who's this?	1																					
7	7		301							1	Talbot	I came across a squad that had been assaulted, and most of them were dead by the time I got there.	2																					
8	8		301									Having heard the noise here, some of the refugees gather around.																						
9	9		201							1	500249		-400																					
10	10		301							1	Emaciated Refugee	Let me help.	1																					
11	11		301								Talbot	I appreciate your sense of humor, but you should probably just stay out of this.	2																					
12	12		201							1	500019		-400				1																	
13	13		301							1	Construct Soldier 1	Out of the way. She was a technician in the reservation area before coming to the Medzone.	1

20	20		301								Lillian	She's got damage all over her body. Some of them seem old, and I'm still working on figuring out the others.	2																					
21	21		301								Emaciated Technician	Right. Let me take care of this part, and you can handle the rest of it.	1

29	29		301								Talbot	I sure never saw this coming. Look at all these new faces we have. We're definitely bigger but more organized as a group now.	2																					
30	30		301								Construct Soldier 1	A lot of them came out when the train collapsed, and we decided to assign them all to different bases because God only knew how long it would take for the train to work again.	1																					
31	31		301								Talbot	The train...	2																					
32	32		301									Talbot fell silent at the mention of the train.																						
33	33		301								Construct Soldier 1	It all happened out of the blue. We ended up with a whole bunch of injured people while short on supplies. It was a total mess.	1																					
34	34		301								Construct Soldier 1	Most of the humans have recovered already and are sharing the workload... The whole situation hasn't really gotten better since, but we've been coping just fine by helping each other out.	1																					
35	35		301								Construct Soldier 1	What are you all doing here, by the way?	1																					
36	36		301								Talbot	It's our turn to guard the place.	2

47	47		301								Talbot	I don't know who he is. Only just met him on our way here. Lillian said he doesn't even remember his own name because of memory loss.	2																					
48	48		301								Construct Soldier 1	Thought you guys finally found someone to be your new capt.	1																					
49	49		301								Talbot	...	2																					
50	50		301								Talbot	The higher-ups ain't got no time to make us a new team now. They just make do with whoever they can find.	2

56	56		301								Construct Soldier 2	Right, and that's because they've taken in way too many refugees, and putting them all back on track hasn't been exactly easy.	2

60	60		301								Emaciated Technician	Alrighty, done with basic check-ups and treatment here. Her M.I.N.D. is still a mess, and it's a miracle that she's conscious at all.	1

76	76		301							1	Emaciated Technician	Let's save that question for later. Her M.I.N.D. isn't exactly stable yet, and we don't have a commandant here. Let's leave her to rest for now.	1

95	95		301								Construct Soldier 4	Are you saying that defecting is any better? Where are we supposed to go? Where is safe even?	2

116	116		301								Talbot	I know we aren't out of harm's way yet, and I probably don't have a second choice, but I'm willing to take whatever comes my way, so long as I can do something to fix this disaster.	1

242	242		301									Back then, conflicts between the upper and lower levels were mostly personal. The lower level wasn't as crowded, and the guards from the upper level were pretty well-mannered.

250	250		301							1	Lower-Level Citizen 1	Alright, "Blessing Boxes" again. Gotta love easy jobs like this!	1																					
251	251		301								Upper-Level Guard	Right. Since this job is relatively easy and the pay is calculated based on how much work you do, Boss wanted us to get a few kids with too much time on their hands to do these for extra earnings.	2																					
252	252		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Of course, and we'd be happy to bring some old hands here, too. They don't have another source of income other than those easy tasks from the Logistics Crew, anyway.	1																					
253	253		301								Upper-Level Guard	Copy that. Sounds like a plan, actually. I'll tell Boss about that.	2

258	258		301							1	???	Do we only need to stuff the things from the bigger box into these "Blessing Boxes"?	1																					
259	259		301								Lower-Level Citizen 2	Yes. You just need to fold up these recycled boxes, wipe off any filthy traces on them, stuff the things from the chest into the boxes, and then seal them up. And keep in mind that you're only supposed to stuff one of each item into a single box.	2																					
260	260		301								???	Right. Thank you.	1

265	265		301									With a paper box in his hands, the boy looks into the bigger box with all sorts of things. The bigger box holds a lot of simple parts, loose medications, and old everyday products.																						
266	266		301									Those things are as good as useless, but other than that, there is a deck of shiny cards sitting neatly in a metal box with a tantalizing shine.

269	269		301							1	???	Sir, what are these cards?	1																					
270	270		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	They're "Blessing Cards".	2																					
271	271		301								???	Blessing Cards?	1																					
272	272		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Yes. There are only so many of them, and you need to be really lucky to have one in the Blessing Box you buy.	2																					
273	273		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	And if you do get one in the lot box you buy, you get to board the train with the card and live with everyone.	2																					
274	274		301								???	Why do you need a Blessing Card to live with everyone, though?	1																					
275	275		201							2	500226		400																					
276	276		301							1	Lower-Level Citizen 2	Haha, son, consider yourself lucky for being a native on the train. You've no idea what's going on out there.	2																					
277	277		301								???	But I do. Mom told me about what's going on out there, but I still don't know why you need a Blessing Card to board the train.	1																					
278	278		202							2					1																			
279	279		201							2	500270		400																					
280	280		301							1	Lower-Level Citizen 1	Because we only have so many seats on the train, and they need "tickets" to board. Have you heard about these tickets?	2																					
281	281		301									He nods earnestly.																						
282	282		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	There aren't many livable places out there. See, if you go to places like refugee bases, medzones, or reservation areas, you'll see that they only take in skilled workers that are young enough.	2																					
283	283		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	And even if they're nice enough to take you in, they won't be able to keep you around for long—because with all sorts of things in short supply, no one wants to keep someone around that can't help with anything.	2																					
284	284		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Which is why the safer the place you go to, the more they want to make sure you really are skilled.	2																					
285	285		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	And you get to stay there if you pass the screening—but the problem is that there are a bunch of people who either failed or have no family members who passed the screening.	2																					
286	286		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	And it's not necessarily the case that they aren't capable of anything. Wherever they went to was probably just a bad fit for them, and it's much too risky for them to travel far away from home for job hunting.	2																					
287	287		301								???	And so they want to hop on the train and go somewhere else?	1																					
288	288		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Exactly, and the train never stops hiring. You'd have to pass the screening, though, of course.	2																					
289	289		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Be it the Cargo Crew, Maintenance Crew, Logistics Crew, or the guards or the service staff up there—they only want people with the right skills and physical condition.	2																					
290	290		301								???	What happens if someone just can't pass a single screening?	1																					
291	291		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Then physical work it is, then, and they're actually short on hands these days.	2																					
292	292		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	Most physical jobs are one-shot deals, though, which is why people don't keep workers around to meet these ad hoc needs.	2																					
293	293		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	If someone is lucky enough to get one of the tickets we stuff into one of the boxes, they can hop onboard and either go to live somewhere safe without having to go through the screening, or form a nomadic squad with others and do their part to help.	2																					
294	294		301								Lower-Level Citizen 1	And the upper level stands to gain part of the supplies, while the lower level gets a few extra hands that can go and help people around. The elder folks and kids would then be able to come and help with making "Blessing Boxes", which makes it possible for everyone to get supplies.	2																					
295	295		301								???	...Hmm...	1

303	303		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After that day...																						
304	304		301									With the Blessing Box gaining traction, the lower level starts growing crowded.																						
305	305		301									They're now seeing an influx of people who failed to pass screenings at other places, and most of the skills they possess do not align with the skills they need to work on the train.																						
306	306		301									To help these people stay above water, the aristocrats form a "Bumblebee" squad that takes in everyone without a stable job.																						
307	307		301									"Bumblebee" does all sorts of outsourced work—be it rebuilding reservation areas, helping with farming, removing ruins from the road that stand in the Cargo Crew's way, or working as ad hoc mercenaries.																						
308	308		301									Most of these people, however, either stay behind in the Industrial Carriage, or head down to all the factories to do simple odd jobs in place of machines that don't work anymore.																						
309	309		301									Things have so far turned out the way everyone had expected them to.																						
310	310		301									Except these "simple" odd jobs quickly get out of hand.																						
311	311		301									Without a proper screening process that filters out those who just aren't meant to be here, the Bumblebee now has quite a few members that are... less than cooperative.

315	315		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	Because of "Bumblebee"?	2																					
316	316		301								Cargo Crew Member 1	Damn straight. This guy was helpin' on the farm with us at the base, and dude was rollin' on the ground whining about how tired he was after getting his pay.	1																					
317	317		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	Haha, ain't no surprise at all. A winner would never even think about buyin' a Blessing Box. You know what I'm talkin' about?	2																					
318	318		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	You'd only buy a Blessing Box if you're too young—in which case you were born havin' no school to go to, where you'd have been able to pick up a skill.	2																					
319	319		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	Or you're too old—in which case you've spent the prime of your life either doin' some creative job, performances, or game designin', except these are all things that could have only kept you alive back in peaceful times.	2																					
320	320		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	I have full respect for all sorts of occupations, and I came across a bunch of these people working different lines of work before going to the reservation area.	2																					
321	321		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	I'm talkin' about those that haven't found themselves a job and are still refusing to be Scavengers.	2																					
322	322		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	Dude, it's a miracle that these people haven't caused any big scene at all doin' physical work. Totes normal that some of them crack doin' it.	2																					
323	323		301								Cargo Crew Member 1	Did you just say it's "normal"? Well, logically speakin', yes, but I'm talkin' about whether they're good fits for the job. See, it's no different than throwing dirt on ACA's reputation.	1																					
324	324		301								Cargo Crew Member 1	And guess what? The Cargo Crew is gettin' dragged through the mud because of all these. When people from reservation areas know we're from ACA now, they just assume we're all a bunch of jerks without botherin' to check our affiliation.	1																					
325	325		301								Cargo Crew Member 2	Gotta put up with that, and we need to give them credit for even getting out there to work at all—they're definitely farin' a lot better than those good-for-nothings that stay behind in the car and steal people's bread from under the pillow.	2

Keepin' those idle Bumblebees around all the time is only more trouble, which is why it makes sense to carry them around and put those hands where they're needed as the train goes.	2																					
331	331		301								Cargo Crew Member 3	But the upper level is supposed to be responsible for those Bumblebees! We're losing spaces to live in down here with all these new people comin', and we've never seen any supplies we've earned making Blessing Boxes.

437	437		301									Rachel looks after most of those living on the lower level—and be it the Cargo Crew or the Bumblebee, no one talks back to her when she talks.																						
438	439		301									She's their hero, leader, and a stable source of resources. She might not always have what you need when you ask her, but come back to her in a few days and she'll have what you need.																						
439	440		301									How exactly does she manage to get her hands on things when there isn't even enough to go around?																						
440	441		301									This question has been on the boy's mind for the longest time. He tried to find out how she does it by bringing up the question to her—to which she only said, "I've got extra pay here."

445	446		301							1	Rachel	I know, but like I've said before, the higher-ups are going to work with someone else if we refuse to do these Blessing Boxes, and that won't help with our situation at all.	1																					
446	447		301								Rachel	We've tried strikes and protests... but at the end of the day, the aristocrats own this train. We won't get a say so long as they're still alive.	1

456	457		301									Everyone here has had their fair share of misfortune—some have shelled away what little resources they had to buy Blessing Boxes, some have sold Blessing Boxes in exchange for shelter, while others make Blessing Boxes to secure supplies without having to put themselves in harm's way.																						
457	458		301									"Blessing Boxes" are like giant magnets—that, as soon as people come in contact with them, suck people into an abyss from which there is no escape.																						
458	459		301									Beyond the train lies nothing but barren land—and those who dare to venture out will find themselves embarking on a journey of endless roaming, looting, and scavenging. Who will they be able to hold accountable? And what are they supposed to do?																						
459	460		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Believe or not to believe—that is the question, one to which no one knows the answer, allowing the status quo to prevail until someone or a group of people explodes with bottled-up rage.
