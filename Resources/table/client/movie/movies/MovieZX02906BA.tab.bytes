4	4		301									By the time the boy has turned 13, the Commoner Carriage has grown so crowded it's unlivable.																						
5	5		301									Bumblebee has taken in so many newcomers over the yearsâ€”that even with all the outsourced work ACA has taken up, they still find work in short supply. The competition for work has never been so fierceâ€”while their wages hit rock bottom again and again.																						
6	6		301									People have grown numb and cruel about all the work-related deaths nowâ€”to the point that some of them find it acceptable to poke fun at those who fall ill and are unable to work, labeling them "pretentious".																						
7	7		301									Those who haven't yet lost their heart have tried all sorts of ways to escape this hellhole. Some have managed to join principled crews through screenings using their skills or power, while still, some pay their way up and secure positions as upper-level guards.																						
8	8		301									The other guards don't think highly of those who pay their way upâ€”yet there is nothing anyone can do with them, so long as they've got the right kind of "connection".																						
9	9		301									Other than these "lucky" ones, those who can't stand how crowded the lower level has become have all decided to quit ACA.																						
10	10		301									Still, there are countless people with nowhere to turn to because they've run out of their resources for Blessing Boxes.

14	14		301									Assad likes to describe the guards as "dickheads," because he thinks their faces look especially punch-able with their filter masks on.																						
15	15		301								Assad	Same deal. We have 10 batches worth of Blessing Boxes to sell, and each batch has five thousand boxes. We'll be going through 10 places, and we'll call it a day whenever we're done.	1																					
16	16		301								Cargo Member Weyland	Wait, 10 batches, and five thousand boxes each? That's two times the workload we did last time!	2																					
17	17		301								Assad	That's what the higher-ups said. Would love to help but can't really do anything about it.	1																					
18	18		301								Cargo Member Weyland	And what are we getting in exchange for the boxes?	2																					
19	19		301								Assad	Medicine, just like last time. Here, I've pasted an exchange price list on the shipping container.	1																					
20	20		301								Cargo Member Weyland	Cut us some slack already. You just can't find people with that much medicine these daysâ€”and even if you can, why would they want Blessing Boxes in return anyways?	2																					
21	21		301								Assad	But we managed to sell all the boxes last time, didn't we? See, you can always find greedy people, and even if they have no medicine to give, they can try asking around to see if people have it, right? C'mon, just zip it and get to work.	1																					
22	22		301								Assad	Because you're gonna get one of those dickheads coming at you if you don't.	1

26	26		301								Cargo Member Weyland	But what revenge? They're just here to supervise us, and that'd be the politically correct way to put it.	2

32	32		301									Ever since a long time ago, the "dickheads"â€”which, in fact, are really guards from the upper levelâ€”have been patrolling the lower level. They maintain that they do so to ensure "work efficiency", except the guards weren't as mean back then.																						
33	33		301									The guards would come to check the items sold and recycledâ€”but over the past few years, they'd suppress people who try to complain with violence, leading to conflict on a regular basis. Rachel, however, hasn't done much to remedy the situation.

42	42		301								Assad	People were supposed to get paid for the amount of work they did, and that's the way things were. But then came 'em "dickheads" with their "paid by assigned quota" ruleâ€”and bam, it's either you meet your assigned quota or you go home empty-handed to mama.	2																					
43	43		301								Assad	And now, we all need to go home empty-handed if there is so much as one of us that fails to meet their quota... And environment-wise, this place pretty much looks like a hellhole now.	2

47	47		301									It's all as what Assad saysâ€”every morning, they'd see a bunch of "dickheads" come down with weapons and pick a few dozen people to work in the Industrial Carriage.																						
48	48		301									Their compensationâ€”two meals and a food voucher for 12 consecutive hours of workâ€”is meager at best, but given the "safe nature" of the job, people would still kill for it.																						
49	49		301									Once picked, you'll be heading down to the Industrial Carriage with 50 or so people under the "dickheads'" supervisionâ€”where you'll find piles and piles of materials and parts waiting for you.																						
50	50		301									To speed things up, the workers are each fed a single cup of instant energy soup twice a day for the two meals they're promisedâ€”and if they need to take care of their business, there is a squat toilet and rainwater purifier in the corner, literally just two steps away.																						
51	51		301									The air reeks of excrement with nothing covering the squat toilet. The rainwater purifier, on the other hand, gets hiccups all the timeâ€”to the point that the boy has seen people die from consuming water with an overly high level of Punishing Virus.																						
52	52		301									Nonetheless, people still work non-stop for 12 hours in this car reeking of sweat and excrementâ€”all for that one single food voucher at the end of the grind. More often than not, however, they'd get I.O.U.'s from the Logistics Crew when they try to get food with the vouchers.																						
53	53		301									If you slack for even just a split second, one of the "dickheads" would start swinging his baton and machine gun at you.
