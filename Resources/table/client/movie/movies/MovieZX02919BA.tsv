482	482		301								Shrek	Don't you think you've gone too far?	1																					
483	483		301									On the 25th day after they started traveling together, the apathetic soul realizes he may still be able to feel anger.																						
484	484		301								Bella	What?	2																					
485	485		301								Shrek	I'm trying to arrive at City 074, not spending the last 25 days drawing a portrait of your mom from your memories.	1																					
486	486		301								Bella	I need to find her, but I don't have a photo of her. Getting you to draw a picture of her sounds like a solid plan to me. And you owed me one, remember?	2																					
487	487		301								Shrek	I haven't practiced drawing since I joined the Cargo Crew. There's no way I can satisfy your unreasonable demands.	1																					
488	488		301								Bella	I'm just asking you to raise her eyebrows.	2																					
489	489		301								Shrek	You asked me to move them lower five minutes ago.	1																					
490	490		301								Bella	Can't you make them a little bit higher while you make them a bit lower? Why is it so hard for you to understand what I'm describing?	2																					
491	491		301								Shrek	...	1																					
492	492		301									Noan takes a deep breath before adjusting the eyebrows with his pen once again.																						
493	493		301								Shrek	How about now?	1																					
494	494		301								Bella	It... still doesn't feel right. Forget the brows for now. Can you make her eyes look a little to the left and a little to the right?	2																					
495	495		301								Shrek	?	1																					
496	496		301								Bella	I remember that her hair was gentle and bountiful like ripened grapevines.	2																					
497	497		301								Shrek	?	1																					
498	498		301								Bella	And her gaze was shimmering like ripples on a lake.	2																					
499	499		301								Shrek	...	1																					
500	500		301									Noan takes another deep breath.																						
501	501		301								Shrek	...Who told you I could draw?	1																					
502	502		301								Bella	Rachel.	2																					
503	503		301								Shrek	Have you considered that she might be joking, and I have no idea how to even hold a pen?	1																					
504	504		301								Bella	That's not possible. She had a drawing you made when you were young in her bag.	2																					
505	505		301								Shrek	And... where did you learn to describe a face this way?	1																					
506	506		301									Bella waves the book in her hand. It is a collection of essays about the author's reflections on life, and the first chapter is filled with passages that depict the beauty of the female lead character.																						
507	507		301									"Her eyes were like apples kissed by gunpowder, reflecting the dusk that the abandoned swan missed..."																						
508	508		301									"The solitude captured inside Mona Lisa's frame painted the colors of her fingertips..."																						
509	509		301									Noan slams the book shut and politely returns it to Bella.																						
510	510		301								Shrek	I think my mom was right about compromising on things you're powerless to do.	1																					
511	511		301								Shrek	I've decided to give up on drawing starting today. I will not fantasize about making a living out of it anymore.	1																					
512	512		301								Bella	Are you always this agonized when you create? Or is it just because you haven't practiced enough?	2																					
513	513		301								Shrek	I am always like this.	1																					
514	514		301								Bella	But you still owe me one, and Rachel said she wanted you to keep drawing after you left the Cargo Crew, didn't she? I'm giving you the tools to fulfill your dreams!	2																					
515	515		301								Shrek	...	1																					
516	516		301								Bella	Keep practicing. Hard work beats talent any day! I'm sure you can do it. So—	2

523	523		301								Bella	I told you you can do it.	2																					
524	524		301								Shrek	We would've gotten here sooner if you had said "a wider gap between the eyes" and "naturally curly hair" instead of "make her eyes look to the left and right" and "her hair was like ripened grapevines."	1																					
525	525		301								Bella	What's wrong with that? I find your inner life much richer than before, unlike the walking dead that you were when I first ran into you.	2																					
526	526		301								Shrek	...You did a good job reviving me by making me roll over in my grave.	1																					
527	527		301									He puts down his pen and stretches his sore fingers.																						
528	528		301								Bella	Stop complaining. Keep an open mind! Let's go!	2																					
529	529		301									Bella waves her hand with great panache, making her way toward the place they agreed upon 50 days ago.

553	553		301								Shrek	Do your self-help books teach you how not to sound like a jerk?	1																					
554	554		301									Bella means well, but Noan has since started to avoid sleeping after losing his way to separate dreams from reality. He is afraid of losing himself once again in his old dreams.																						
555	555		301									Worried, Noan often sits all night by himself until the sun rises. Lacking sleep, he starts struggling with their journey during the day after a while.																						
556	556		301									After seeing Noan pass out once during their travel, Bella has to start making sure he sleeps.																						
557	557		301								Bella	I wasn't expecting to be a mother this young. Can't you take better care of yourself?	2																					
558	558		301								Shrek	...You're free to let me be.	1																					
559	559		301								Bella	Look, I'm not as good as an ex-Cargo Cargo Captain when it comes to handling troubles on the road, alright? Do you know how much harder it is for me to survive if you drop dead now?	2																					
560	560		301									Noan does not want to worry her, but he still struggles to sleep normally, so he ends up learning to pretend to snore.
