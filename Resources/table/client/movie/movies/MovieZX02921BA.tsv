7	7		301							1	Bella	I thought you were taking a walk. You went to pick flowers?	2																					
8	8		301								Shrek	...Kind of.	1																					
9	9		301								Bella	Hard to find a pear tree these days.	2																					
10	10		301								Shrek	Any news?	1																					
11	11		301								Bella	Yeah.	2																					
12	12		301									She sits across Noan with a solemn expression.																						
13	13		301								Bella	She died... three years ago. She got ill. Didn't even live to see the rebellion.	2																					
14	14		301								Bella	She left this journal before she died and gave her possessions to a friend.	2																					
15	15		301									Bella waves the thin booklet in her hand.																						
16	16		301								Bella	She kept believing that... things would get better after the rebellion won. There would be schools on the lower level; people wouldn't have to fight for food or the bathroom. Then she would be brave enough to find me.	2																					
17	17		301								Shrek	...	1																					
18	18		301								Bella	What do you think? Has her dream come true... or has everything gone to shit?	2																					
19	19		301									She struggles to hold back her tears.																						
20	20		301								Bella	Don't you cry. Tears are useless. They can't save anyone.	2																					
21	21		301								Shrek	...Don't repeat what my mom would say. And aren't you the one crying?	1																					
22	22		301									He is sobbing too.																						
23	23		301								Bella	So what if I repeat her words? That just proves that it's a universal truth passed down from generation to generation.	2																					
24	24		301								Shrek	Just because it's passed down from our elders doesn't mean it's true. A lot of their ideas are outdated.	1																					
25	25		301								Bella	It's still better than those fantasies you won't stop reading. Ordinary folks will never become the all-powerful heroes in your Cardman Rider books.	2																					
26	26		301								Shrek	Cardman Riders aren't all-power. Their stories are captivating only because they struggle too.	1																					
27	27		301									They both look up and frown, their grief suppressed again.																						
28	28		301								Bella	The real world isn't like your story. We don't always stand back up after we fall.	2																					
29	29		301								Shrek	So you do realize that? I thought you were all "adversity builds character," like your books.	1																					
30	30		301								Bella	Adversity is always destructive. I'm just willing to believe that it can make me a better person.	2																					
31	31		301								Shrek	That's just wishful thinking you use to make yourself feel better.	1																					
32	32		301								Bella	Nothing wrong with making yourself feel better. People aren't supposed to stay stuck.	2																					
33	33		301								Bella	You smiled so freely when I first met you, but look at your face now. Stuck, see?	2																					
34	34		301								Shrek	Surely someone who never smiles doesn't get to say that about me.	1																					
35	35		301									Bella sneers.																						
36	36		301								Bella	What happened on the train that day that made you this way?	2																					
37	37		301								Shrek	Haven't you been listening to what people were saying?	1																					
38	38		301								Bella	Those were their stories, not yours. Shrek isn't your real name, is it?	2																					
39	39		301								Shrek	Does it matter?	1																					
40	40		301								Bella	Obviously. A name represents a person's past and present.	2																					
41	41		301								Shrek	Some past is just trouble. I don't want to explain and justify myself wherever I go.	1																					
42	42		301								Bella	If that still bothers you, then you haven't made peace with your past.	2																					
43	43		301								Shrek	...	1																					
44	44		301								Shrek	I couldn't bring them back even if I made peace. Haven't you also hidden many things from me?	1																					
45	45		301								Bella	You never asked.	2																					
46	46		301								Shrek	Will you answer if I ask now?	1																					
47	47		301								Bella	No.	2																					
48	48		301								Shrek	Me neither.	1																					
49	49		301								Bella	...	2																					
50	50		301								Bella	Doesn't it bother you when partners don't communicate with each other?	2																					
51	51		301								Shrek	What's wrong with the way we were? We could talk about our books.	1																					
52	52		301								Bella	Would that have gotten anything through your thick skull? You have to learn to move past your regrets.	2																					
53	53		301								Shrek	The same goes for you, I reckon.	1																					
54	54		301								Bella	I need time.	2																					
55	55		301								Shrek	Sure, but so do I.	1																					
56	56		301									As their conversation comes to an impasse, Bella changes the subject, her brows furrowed.																						
57	57		301								Bella	Will you go back to Asslam?	2																					
58	58		301								Shrek	And do what?	1																					
59	59		301								Bella	Fair. As long as Ashlar and his people are there, there's no way you can return... Do you want to keep going with me, then?	2																					
60	60		301								Shrek	Where will you go?	1																					
61	61		301								Bella	I'm planning to stay here for a while before deciding where to go next. There can't be anything worse out there, after all.	2																					
62	62		301								Shrek	Can I offer you a new, blessed name in this trying time?	1

65	65		301								Bella	That won't be necessary.	2

73	73		301								Shrek	It didn't take a disaster, just some other Scavengers like us that we didn't watch out for. Then you were gone.																						
74	74		301								Shrek	...																						
75	75		301								Shrek	Thank you, Bella.																						
76	76		301								Shrek	I should have said that sooner.																						
77	77		301								Shrek	You found me when I was most lost, and you helped me along the way...																						
78	78		301								Shrek	You could be quite annoying sometimes—but I suppose there's blame to share. Had I not met you, I won't be standing here, safe and sound.																						
79	79		301								Shrek	So, thank you... and I'm sorry... I never told you my story.																						
80	80		301								Shrek	"Spring will return... Your favorite flowers will bloom again..." Only when you told me that did I realize...																						
81	81		301								Shrek	...I never got to tell you how I got the pear blossoms in my books.																						
82	82		301								Shrek	We were always hiding our past, so we could only talk about the books we loved.																						
83	83		301								Shrek	You might have become a merchant for the Forsaken like I did if you had survived. Who knows? Maybe eventually we could be honest with each other... and become real friends.																						
84	84		301								Shrek	...It's too late for any of that, isn't it?																						
85	85		301								Shrek	Mom, Captain Rachel, Field, Shauna, Niino, Weyland, Ed, Aunt Hill... Everyone I cared for on the train is gone...																						
86	86		301								Red Tide Projection	...Will you go back to Asslam?																						
87	87		301									The phantom keeps repeating Bella's words at random. The young man is not bothered and instead starts chatting with the familiar voice.																						
88	88		301								Shrek	There's no reason to return anymore.																						
89	89		301								Shrek	I ran into Mike at a Forsaken base a few months ago. He told me Niino had passed too.

97	97		301							1	Captain Mike	Niino's old injuries had long-lasting complications in the first place. He was eating less and less in the last few years, and last month he fell asleep one night and never woke up.	1																					
98	98		301								Captain Mike	He knew that you survived, and he heard I was preparing to leave Akdilek, so he asked me to give you back your things.	1																					
99	99		301								Captain Mike	He said no one on the train was going to keep an eye on your things after he was gone.	1																					
100	100		301									Mike took out a familiar backpack filled with things Noan left behind.																						
101	101		301									The short sword Noan used, the weapon designs Rachel gave him, Field's journal, and a manga with a bookmark resting between the pages.																						
102	102		301								Captain Mike	I was going to bring you a piece of candy, but I lost it on my way here. Sigh.	1

116	116		301								Shrek	A lot of things are getting better there. Perhaps a school will show up on the lower level in a few years like your mother wished.	1																					
117	117		301								Shrek	He said our sacrifices weren't in vain...	1																					
118	118		301									He turns around, patting the border collie by his side, deep in thought.																						
119	119		301								Shrek	So he decided to leave Akdilek and started a new journey.	1																					
120	120		301								Shrek	So have I... After you were gone, I started to teach myself how to perform surgery. There are still a lot I don't understand...	1																					
121	121		301								Shrek	But whatever I can do, I want to give it my all. I want to stay with other people and contribute like I did.	1																					
122	122		301								Shrek	Eventually, I had an arrangement with the Forsaken and became one of their merchants.	1																					
123	123		301								Shrek	But the Red Tide flooded the cities again after the disaster at the Pulia Forest Park Ruins... And it took so many lives.	1																					
124	124		301									He stared at the projected phantom in the Red Tide and pauses.																						
125	125		301								Shrek	They never stopped fighting, no matter how hopeless it was, even if it cost their lives. The way they fought reminded me of the people on the train.	1

135	135		301								Shrek	What is the point of it when none of you are here anymore, even if our dream has come true?	1																					
136	136		301								Shrek	Only when I saw those who would die defending the people from this calamity did I realize... I was right not to give Ashlar the terminal that day.	1																					
137	137		301								Shrek	I would have betrayed them if I had compromised. Their sacrifices would have been in vain.	1																					
138	138		301								Shrek	Spring will come like you said...	1																					
139	139		301								Shrek	...Winter does not take, for some would light fires with their souls.	1																					
140	140		301									Noan looks up and chuckles wryly.																						
141	141		301								Shrek	Someone dies defending against this disaster every second... They build a dam with their lives to keep the flood out.	1																					
142	142		301								Shrek	I would have made the same choices I did if I was in the same situation, wouldn't I?	1																					
143	143		301								Shrek	Not because I've decided to give up the possibility they gave me... I'm just making the same choice they did. I'm passing this ticket to the future to someone else.	1																					
144	144		301								Shrek	Goodbye, Bella. I have to take Matches to the Forsaken base. They're still waiting for these serums.	1
