4	5		301									The girl with grey long hair sits quietly next to the window, gazing into the galaxy outside.																						
5	6		301									To the people living on the Earth, an incredibly long time has passed. The battles fought against despair had turned into history, and history turned into legends. The legends were carved in the civilization's legacy, which eventually became fairy tales that parents told their children.																						
6	7		301									But to "them," this is just a short break before entering the next "warp." Time and distance have expanded infinitely following the spaceship's trail in the cosmic dust. Each step it ventures forward, it leaves hundreds and thousands of years behind.																						
7	8		301									DeLorean-Discovery continues to sail among the stars.																						
8	9		301									The girl's main consciousness is located in the center of the ship, but she still occasionally separates a trivial section of her computing power and projects it into this library as a hologram.																						
9	10		301									Mechanoids rarely visit here. The simulated gravity is constantly kept at 9.8 m/s2. Not even a dust has changed its position.																						
10	11		301									Not long ago, a girl's consciousness had crossed time and space to visit. They chatted for a long time, and she finally got her answer. She continued her journey toward the destined future, unwavering.																						
11	12		301									—That is why they all arrive here eventually.																						
12	13		301									Now the library is quiet again, the girl is still sitting next to the window. In her eyes is the reflection of a planet on the border of the galaxy. Its surface is always occupied by never-ending crimson tides that make it look like a burning planet when looked from afar.																						
13	14		301									This is but an ordinary planet on the spaceship's path. No lives of any form can survive here. The answer that machines have been looking for cannot be found here.																						
14	15		401							1	36																							
15	16		301									Still, its color makes the girl feel nostalgic. She remembers the future that she saw through Gestalt's calculation a long time ago.

72	73		301									The signals of lives displayed in her terminal are rapidly disappearing. Nobody can stop "her," as they are no match for "her." Chiko looks up at the giant shadow as it walks over the waves, gradually engulfing her.

121	122		301									A gentle female voice pulls her back from memories. It is one of the commonly used voices of Discovery's AI administrator.																						
122	123		301								"Nanami"	Huh?																						
123	124		301								???	We have begun to approach the target wormhole. The next warp is expected to commence in 40 minutes.																						
124	125		301									The hologram of a white-haired female appears next to Nanami, with a hint of concern in her light golden eyes.																						
125	126		301								???	What's wrong?																						
126	127		301								"Nanami"	Nothing. Some memories just came to me.																						
127	128		401							2	2566																							
128	129		301									She raises her hand to open a light screen. It displays a document tagged with "Copperfield Aquarium Campaign".																						
129	130		301									Unlike the calculated ending, the reality went another path. After Bianca was injured, Chiko took over and headed to the bottom of the sea first. In this document, there are unnoticeable signs of adjustments and amendments regarding the allocation of their duties.																						
130	131		301									What had happened to alter the inevitable disaster that took place in the calculation?																						
131	132		301									Inadvertently, she glances at a photo of a lamp in the document. Finally figuring it out, she casts away the light screen and opens a new time-space map, then enters a set of coordinates.																						
132	133		401							2	1227																							
133	134		301									The light spot runs along the information tree, finally stopping at the marked location.																						
134	135		402							1227																								
135	136		301								"Nanami"	Haicma, can you help me pack up File No. 2143 and make it ready for 4-dimensional communication? There's something I'd like to send to the Earth.																						
136	137		301								"Haicma"	Understood.																						
137	138		301								"Haicma"	...Are you sure this is what you want to send?																						
138	139		401							2	2566																							
139	140		301									Slightly uncertain, the AI asks Nanami after extracting the information she wanted.																						
140	141		301								"Haicma"	The humans on the Earth have already mastered all the related technologies. This information is already outdated to them.																						
141	142		301								"Nanami"	You're right.																						
142	143		301									The girl points at the time-space coordinates on the display.																						
143	144		301								"Nanami"	I'm sending it here.																						
144	145		301								"Haicma"	But mankind didn't have the ability to receive 4-dimensional communications at that point of time. Besides...																						
145	146		301								"Nanami"	I know.																						
146	147		301									With a delighted smile, the girl puts one finger next to her lips.																						
147	148		301								"Nanami"	That brief moment is their only chance.																						
148	149		301								"Nanami"	With the Phantom Tracer and lots of Hetero-Creatures...																						
149	150		301								"Nanami"	As long as there is a fragment that has the 4-dimensional feature, it can become the vessel for this information.																						
150	151		301								"Nanami"	Besides, they have to look for the "door" themselves. I'm only sending a fragment of the key.																						
151	152		301								"Haicma"	...Understood.																						
152	153		301									Seeing the girl's smile, the AI's expression has also softened.																						
153	154		301								"Haicma"	The information has been encapsulated. Time-space coordinates locked. It will be sent out during Discovery's wormhole warp.																						
154	155		301								"Haicma"	The engine is about to start. We should go to the control room.																						
155	156		301								"Nanami"	Alright.																						
156	157		401							2	2566																							
157	158		301									She turns off the time-space map and rises to her feet, preparing to send all computing power back to the control center. The light screen is set to standby, displaying a slow-spinning illusion of a blue planet amidst the brilliant stars.																						
158	159		301									She takes one last look at the blue planet. Discovery has crossed numerous spiral arms of galaxies. She has been to so many radiant stars and witnessed so many majestic views, but none of the planets can match its beauty.																						
159	160		301								"Nanami"	This is my gift to them... The "future."																						
160	161		301									She speaks softly as her illusion gradually disappears. The library is once again empty.
