7	7		301								Lee	No point trying to be safe in the enemy's den. If Huaxu wanted to harm us, it would've been done already.	1

9	9		301									While everyone is still hesitant, the platform rattles and begins to descend.

18	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The slow and steady rumbles follow as the platform descends, looming closer toward the dueling Ascendants underneath.																						
19	20		301									Roland barely escapes Alpha's strike to his throat, but her blade carries such intense energy that it still leaves a cut on his face.																						
20	21		301									It may just be a light wound, but the difference in their strength has nonetheless had Roland concerned.

30	31		301								Huaxu	Gray Raven has arrived at the target destination.																						
31	32		301									Following Huaxu's emotionless announcement, the platform lift reaches its lowest level, its rusting gears clashing together in an earsplitting noise.
