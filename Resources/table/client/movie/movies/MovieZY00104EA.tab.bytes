7	6		301									He has not actually fought you, but the West General poses weirdly after Lucia has passed the trial to demonstrate his defeat.																						
8	7		301									He buries his head inside his hands, then half-kneels on the floor before falling to the ground with a "Thud!" while groaning painfully.																						
9	1002		302								What a realistic performance.	4000	A little bit hyperbolic, isn't it?	4001																				
10	4000	8	201							1	500166																							
11	8	10	301							1	Lucia	He does act like a defeated villain, doesn't he? But we really should focus on our surroundings right now, Commandant.	1																					
12	4001	9	201							1	500166																							
13	9	10	301							1	Lucia	He should've fallen immediately. But we really should focus on our surroundings right now, Commandant.	1																					
14	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After Lucia points it out, you realize that the recon drones are also falling alongside the West General. With that, the holographic projections around you begin to crumble.

21	12		301							1	Liv	What is this place?	1																					
22	13		301								Lee	What it was originally, I imagine. It looks to be a factory.	2																					
23	1008		204							1	4																							
24	14		301									With that, Lee walks toward the giant screen and opens the terminal with the black box he carries.																						
25	1009		302								What are you looking for?	15	Is this a good idea?	16																				
26	15	19	301								Lee	Just what this factory was built for. Maybe we can even figure out why so many mechanoids gather here.	2																					
27	16	17	301								Lee	I'm certain there will be an order to investigate this place after this. We're going to save some time if we start preparing now.	2																					
28	17	18	301								Liv	But isn't this place maintained by Foreman and the others?	1																					
29	18	19	301								Lee	I'm not digging for their secrets. I'm just trying to find out what this factory originally was.	2																					
30	19		301									Lee begins to decipher the factory's terminal afterward, and data soon appear on the screen.

34	20		301							1	Lucia	Are these records of the factory?	3																					
35	21		301								Lee	Correct. It seems like this is an assembly line of a packaging plant—a medium-to-low-level one, judging by its scale.	2																					
36	22		301								Lee	Pay attention to this... notice of cessation.	2																					
37	23		301								Lee	There's a more detailed explanation underneath. Basically, all human employees were ordered to evacuate because of the Punishing Virus.	2																					
38	1013		302								That was par for the course back then.	24	Just humans?	25																				
39	24	4002	301								Lee	Indeed. This kind of operation was happening everywhere back in those days, but the point is they only evacuated the human employees...	2																					
40	25	4002	301								Lee	Indeed. To lessen the pressure on the operations and guarantee their efficiency, only humans were evacuated.	2																					
41	4002		204							1	14																							
42	26		301								Liv	So, Foreman and the others...	1																					
43	27		301								Lee	There are no concrete proofs, but we can assume that they are the mechanoids that got left behind.	2																					
44	28		301								Lee	Although I'm not sure how they managed to avoid the Punishing Virus, they've somehow survived until now, and, following the schedule of the factory...	2																					
45	29		301								Lee	They gather here to celebrate the festivals.	2																					
46	30		301								Lee	This is just a guess, of course. I simply noticed that days like the Double Seventh Festival and the Ghost Festival are marked on their calendar.	2																					
47	31		301								Liv	Even with the humans gone and the factory abandoned... they're still gathering here according to custom.	1																					
48	32		301								Lee	Following their routines is a fundamental part of their programming logic. There's nothing unusual for them to act like this.	2																					
49	33		301								Liv	...	1																					
50	34		301								Lee	That's about everything we can find out about this place. Let's focus on the last trial.	2																					
51	1014		302								Let's get going.	35																						
52	35		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Right.	3
