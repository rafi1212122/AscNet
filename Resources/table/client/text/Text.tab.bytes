DormDesSecond	Dormitory comfort contains Beauty, Comfort and Practicality, and different mates prefer different stats.\nEnter the warehouse to check the stats that the Constructs/Transcendants/Corrupted/Humans prefer. Comfort can improve the Stamina recovery speed of the Construct (Note:. If the stats your mate prefers is high, Mood can also be restored).\nOnly one Dormitory is unlocked at the beginning, then you can use Decor tokens to unlock other Dormitories one by one. Each Dormitory can support up to 3 mates.\n\nYou can buy Decors from the shop (Note: the stats of any decor in the shop is fixed), or obtain via build/refit.\nYou can only build "Basic Decor Set", and can define its stats by yourself.\nRefit means you can change the appearance of any decor by spending the corresponding blueprint (may have special effects).\n\nMates with high Mood can regularly send gifts to you. So try your best to increase the Mood of your mates.
DormDesWork	Expend Stamina of Constructs to do chores for Dorm Coins.\nEach Chore done will use almost all of a Construct's Stamina.\nStamina spent affects the output of Dorm Coins.\nChore attempts can be increased through unlocking more Dormitories.\nChore attempts reset at 07:00 AM UTC daily.

BossSingleDesc	You can challenge bosses here. 3 random bosses will appear (2 in Basic).\nBosses are divided into Groups Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥, and will be refreshed.\nDefeating a boss will earn your Progress. You will be automatically rewarded for reaching certain Progress.\nProgress ranking will be tallied every Monday. You will be rewarded based on your ranking.\nYou cannot challenge uncleared stages when character Stamina reaches 0. Character Stamina refreshes with every reset.\nYou can challenge bosses 4 times from Monday to Friday and 8 times from Saturday to Sunday.\nAuto Clear will only give you 80% of your highest previous Progress.\nAuto Clear will still reduce character Stamina and consume attempts.
BossSingleAutoFightDesc	Auto Clear will only give you 80% of your highest previous record.\nAuto Clear will still reduce Construct Stamina and exhaust attempts.\nAuto Clear can be used 9 times in total until the next reset.
