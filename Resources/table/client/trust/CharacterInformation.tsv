Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>

111	1041003	3	No.003	The frame can create ion beams through electric potential difference generated by its internal energy bank, thereby controlling the positive and negative charge movements to create lightning for attacking enemies. When all frame restrictions are removed, it can even change the weather in a certain area to cause thunder strikes.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
112	1041003	4	No.004	The Science Council has upgraded and repaired the frame, but due to Daedalus' immature Construct technology, extended usage of this frame can still cause deviations for Bianca's consciousness model over time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
113	1041003	5	No.005	Bianca kept this frame in good shape to remind herself to never forget the past.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>

The robotic arms are linked to her M.I.N.D. with a sync rate reaching 99.78%, meaning that Sophia can control these arms without delay.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
117	1111002	3	No.003	Sophia's consciousness came from an orphan abandoned in the refuse collection carriage of Asslam. Without a name and parents, this little girl, known as Hyena, managed to survive and became one of the train technicians of Akdilek.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>

127	1021004	1	No.001	BPL-01GR, code name Plume. Developed from all the available combat records of Gray Raven, this frame is flexible against all sorts of enemies, but the emphasis on burst power makes it somewhat unstable.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
128	1021004	2	No.002	As the chief developer of this frame, Asimov had Nikola's permission to use the available data of Alpha, along with other observation records. As a result, this frame was closer to the "original" Lucia rather than Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
129	1021004	3	No.003	After the battle in Kowloong City, she imported all the memory data of Lucia, including Alpha's. However, it is worth noting that Plume is not the same Lucia as everybody knew.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
130	1021004	4	No.004	The additional thrusters installed on legs and back provide Plume with exceptional instantaneous acceleration and allow her to make sophisticated moves. The back thruster can even be removed and used as a weapon.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>

134	1131002	2	No.002	"You want to know about Cerberus' commandant? Save it. You're not getting anything from me."\nAs part of the first batch of experimental Babylonia troops for mind linking, the Cerberus squad has always been without a commandant for unspoken reasons. They have always been looking for a commandant that can remotely link with their minds.\nIn the battle in Kowloong Metropolis, Cerberus was assigned a commandant and can finally fight while mind-linked.

135	1131002	3	No.003	"Still alive? Looks like your suffering gets to continue."\nOnly through suffering—the other's, the world's, her own—can Vera prove that she exists, prove that she still lives.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
136	1131002	4	No.004	Due to Vera's extremist methodology, sharp tongue, unscrupulous pillaging, and murky stance, her reputation is in the exhaust system between the Construct squads.\nThere are, however, some Constructs that admire her ways. For instance, the Hellhound squad, whose name even mimics Cerberus', is filled with Vera's fanatical followers.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
137	1131002	5	No.005	As one of the members of Kurono Spec Ops, she worked with Lee for a short while.\nVera's time in Kurono made her more resolute in her belief that the only way to survive in this pain-stricken world is to plunder and attack.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
138	1131002	6	No.006	For various reasons, Cerberus has always been in a chaotic flux under the leadership of Vera—even being described as "the Rabid Dogs" by other Construct squads. Although disorderly and disobedient, the members remain subtly united.\nWhile looking for a commandant capable of establishing a M.I.N.D. connection, the actions of Gray Ravens' commandant caught the attention of Vera.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
139	1511003	1	No.001	Transcendant, Vanguard. Good at using his greatsword to tear everything apart.\nOne of the experimental subjects of a secret Babylonia program.\nAs a Transcendant, he can use Asimov's specially tuned frame to move freely even in high viral density regions.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
140	1511003	2	No.002	"So it did end up like this... What a loathsome world." Writes his emotions, likes and dislikes on his face. Always trusts his instincts.\nJoined Kurono's early secret experiment, and as such, he bears great disgust for Kurono.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>

Kamui and Camu eventually made peace with each other's existence - a sign of both of their acceptance and growth.\nInformation on Camu and Kamui's relationship, as well as relevant information about "Kamui" has become classified information. The last person to view the files was Nikola.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
142	1511003	4	No.004	After a complete scan by Asimov, Camu's memories were found to have been tampered with.\nSome portions of it were archived. Due to thought model stability and frame compatibility concerns, Babylonia has decided to fully monitor Camu and return his consciousness to Kamui's frame at scheduled intervals.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
143	1511003	5	No.005	Because of the viral corruption from within and without, the frame that Camu is currently using, though specially tuned by Asimov, still deteriorates at a jawbreaking pace.\nAs such, Asimov is using Kamui's frame as a sample to look into Tenebrion as a possible solution.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
144	1511003	6	No.006	As a special and experimental case, after Camu was brought back the Gray Raven, he was assigned to the task force. Camu's profile reads him as part of the Strike Hawk, but in reality, he listens directly to Gray Raven for dead zone missions.\nThe reason to why Camu agreed to be part of Babylonia is still a mystery.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
145	1141003	1	No.001	IH-31C, Rosetta, humanoid-hybrid Construct manufactured by the Arctic Route Union. Rosetta uses a transformable spear as her primary means of combat and is a highly mobile and powerful Construct. She can transform into a human-form Construct through casting off her centaur module. In her human form, her charge attack potential is even more formidable through the added auroral wings and HFEM levitation device.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
146	1141003	2	No.002	"If I go out of control again, please don't hesitate. It's for my own good..." A previous exposure to the virus has put Rosetta's M.I.N.D. in an unstable state. She has since been plagued by worries about any lingering traces of the virus causing her to go out of control again.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
147	1141003	3	No.003	Though Rosetta is used to being alone, she does not dislike social interaction. Quite the opposite, all members of the Forest Guard know that Rosetta is more afraid of solitude than any of them, and that she treasures their bonds the greatest too.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
148	1141003	4	No.004	"I did not believe in Babylonia's theories about humanoid-hybrid Constructs at first, but after taking on a human form, I do feel like I'm still human sometimes." Due to Babylonia's technical issues, Rosetta has operated in her human form after she allied with Babylonia. This seems to have made her realize that, before she became part of the Forest Guard, she was just a normal girl.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
149	1141003	5	No.005	"Only by my staying here, will the Forest Guard be accepted by the others." Though the skirmish with the Ascendants has made the port-dwellers rethink their relationship with the Forest Guard, most members of the union administration are still wary of the Forest Guard out of fear and loathing. By staying in Babylonia as a representative ally, Rosetta restrains any overt movements from the union traditionalists.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
150	1141003	6	No.006	Rosetta was not assigned a team after joining Babylonia. In principal, all squads can apply for her support. In reality, Rosetta has only worked with the Gray Raven and operated in HQ-related missions. The only commandant she has ever worked with is the Gray Raven's.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
151	1521003	1	No.001	After the siege war at the end of Golden Age, Qu volunteered to become a Construct using KCC's own technologies in order to protect Tabula Akasha. During the experiment, it was found that she had excellent Tantalum-193 Copolymer adaptability, which made her one of the most complete KCC Constructs.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
152	1521003	2	No.002	Limited by the technologies used, Qu's Construct had relatively weaker resistance against the Punishing Virus, so she never left KCC territory until she met an "Agent" and became a Transcendant. Finally, she got to witness how humans survive in the rest of the world.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
153	1521003	3	No.003	Due to lack of information, Qu was once marked by Babylonia as an Ascendant during the war of Kowloong Metropolis. As the research on Venus Splash Park and Dead Zone progressed, it was learned that Qu was actually a Transcendant like Camu. She was never bothered by the identity given to her though, for it was merely one of many tools to realize Tabula Akasha.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
154	1521003	4	No.004	Raised as the Monarch of Kowloong, Qu is a master strategist who can easily guide the opponent into her trap.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
155	1521003	5	No.005	Qu completely disappeared from the surface after the war of Kowloong Metropolis. Many claimed to have witnessed her around the globe, but none of them could be verified. Reports from unknown senders also pointed out that Qu was in touch with the commandant of Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
156	1521003	6	No.006	"Tell me more about you." Being protective as she is, Qu wants to know the complete information of those she sees as important, and make sure it is well-remembered.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
157	1161002	1	No.001	ADL-17, Changyu, once a member of the Kowloong Theater. He boarded the Nighter during the Golden Age war, but lost all memories after getting the "Collar." He later managed to escape the Nighter and became a guard of Akdilek.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
158	1161002	2	No.002	His frame highlights the young man's agility and explosive power, allowing him to push his martial arts to a new level. The color of his pupils may change temporarily when the frame is running at maximum power.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
159	1161002	3	No.003	After getting his memories back, Changyu often missed the meals he had with everyone back in the theater, so he started to practice cooking. He ended up giving out all the dishes to civilians as Constructs did not need to eat, but Kowloong cuisine was not received well on the train, and the lack of aesthetic appeal certainly did not help. Few civilians would like to take his food, so he slowly gave up cooking. Although he never mentioned it, he still felt bitter about the result.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
160	1161002	4	No.004	The copper coin in Changyu's hand was his "loot" from an operation. Originally a limited token issued within the Nighter, many wealthy people used it to show their identity and status. Changyu often took advantage of this, and it became a habit even when he no longer had the need.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
161	1161002	5	No.005	"Never abandoning each other—never leaving each other. That's a promise, okay?! Keep this promise no matter what happens." Changyu witnessed too much separation and betrayal in the slums of Kowloong. This is the first time that he completely lets down his guard to offer the commandant a promise and an invitation.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
162	1161002	6	No.006	"War took everything that I was familiar with. I will do my best to protect you so this won't happen again." If anyone ever asks Changyu why he would do that, he will say it is for the promise and he does not want to fail the commandant's trust. But there is another reason that he will never say: he hopes that one day, the commandant can sit with him together on a dinner table and enjoy his dishes like family.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
163	1171003	1	No.001	This unit preserved Luna's original form when she was remodeled. The external equipment is made of Punishing Heteromer, which is exceptionally durable and lightweight. Luna can make a variety of weapons by altering the shape of Heteromer, inflicting varied attacks. And she has the ability to go from devastating attack to impenetrable defense in the blink of an eye.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
164	1171003	2	No.002	"I shall lead them in rebuilding this world, and my first mission will be to terminate the existence of Babylonia..." Luna believes that human hubris and greed are the root causes of all catastrophes. They are arrogant and aloof, and they seek to reclaim the world, which has fallen into despair due to their deeds.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
165	1171003	3	No.003	Luna, as Agent, has the power and responsibility to choose Constructs and mechanoids to become new Ascendants. Unfortunately, only a few have made it, and the majority have become the Corrupted. Luna used to be saddened by the plight of those Corrupted who have not been blessed by the Ascension-Network.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
166	1171003	4	No.004	"Sister... Please stay by my side till I fall asleep." Luna did not find peace and tranquility until Alpha became an Ascendant. Although she is the Ascendant's leader, she is still the young girl scared of loneliness in front of her sister.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
167	1171003	5	No.005	Luna is adamant about finding her other sister before everything is destroyed and persuading her to join her cause, even if force is needed. Luna feels that after all is settled, she will understand.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
168	1171003	6	No.006	"I've known long ago that you, not Babylonia, are the real threat to Ascendant..." More than once Luna had been convinced that Babylonia's frail power would crumble in the face of the Ascendants' attacks, and that humans would perish as well. Finally, she learned that despair, not the virus or the Corrupted, is capable of destroying the world. As a result, the most difficult situation arises when people who refuse to give up hope band together.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
169	1181003	1	No.001	2B is an all-purpose battle android from the automated YoRHa infantry. She is equipped with a multitude of blades for close-quarters combat and can attack from range using the POD support system.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>

171	1181003	3	No.003	Among the belligerent Model B androids, 2B is comparatively cool, calm, and collected.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
172	1181003	4	No.004	Additionally, she has deep trust in 9S for carrying out joint combat operations. Her concern for his safety is enough to mitigate her erratic behavior.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
173	1181003	6	No.005	"This is YoRHa unit 2B...If anyone is listening to this, there's something I need you to do. If you ever meet up with YoRHa unit 9S..."\n"I want him...I mean..."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
174	1191003	1	No.001	This unit's official title is Model S, Number 9. While this YoRHa member possesses offensive capabilities, he specializes in survey missions—and is particularly skilled at information gathering and hacking.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
175	1191003	2	No.002	Shares a sentiment similar to that of affection toward 2B.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
176	1191003	3	No.003	While 9S normally had a kind personality, he began to exhibit hatred for ██ when she killed ████. In a cruel twist, he also met end at the hands of ██.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>

181	1201003	3	No.003	This particular unit—whose official title is Class A, Number 2—was wanted by Command for desertion and ordered to be destroyed on sight.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
182	1201003	4	No.004	Our R&D group is currently conducting further research to determine whether or not there were issues with this model's personality settings.\n*The missing experimental unit, now designated "A2," will be handled by the Type █ division.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
183	1201003	6	No.005	She first appeared in the Forest Castle, where she slew the ████. 2B and 9S engaged her in combat, but she managed to escape.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
184	1211002	1	No.001	BPE-47, Wanshi, Strike Hawk Construct. Has a background in Construct maintenance, but also proficient in human medical science. Renowned for his highly accurate and efficient multi-task medical support. Evidence has shown that Wanshi's presence reduces the team's mission injury by 80 percentage points on average.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
185	1211002	2	No.002	"The sober world doesn't seem so bad with you around." Wanshi has witnessed too many secrets and knows the consequences too well. This leads to him being very casual in many situations, but also causes misunderstanding often.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
186	1211002	3	No.003	Wanshi found it difficult to accept the greater goal of mankind due to some secrets that were purposely concealed by Star of Life. This was part of the reason that he gave up the career in Star of Life and chose to become a Construct instead. He finally found what he could and wanted to do in the Task Force.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
187	1211002	4	No.004	"No medical disturbance!" Wanshi is great at handling conflicts, both medically and socially, and often acts as a mediator. However, if the conflict roots from himself, he often chooses to take a step back.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
188	1211002	5	No.005	"Sigh, that felt so exhausting." Never sitting when he can lie down, Wanshi always prefers the most effective and cost-efficient solution, both in battle and in life. However, if his companions are in danger, he would not hesitate to choose an action that completely contradicts this principle.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
189	1211002	6	No.006	Wanshi's outstanding abilities are often concealed by his laid-back attitude. Nobody wants to be Wanshi's enemy when he gets serious. He is often assigned more dangerous missions, and therefore knows a great number of secrets.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
190	1531003	1	No.001	Once an opera singer and an artist, Selena was born in Babylonia and received aristocrat-style education. Her beautiful voice and musical talents once made her the most anticipated rising star in the World Government Association of Art in Babylonia.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
191	1531003	2	No.002	Selena's current body is not made by Babylonia. Instead, it was a joint effort between the Red Tide and an "Agent". The Red Tide detected the Hetero-core shard inside her and almost reshaped her into a Hetero-Creature-like abomination, but thanks to her strong mind, she managed to end this process with self-destruction.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
192	1531003	3	No.003	Selena suffered prolonged exposure to Hetero-core shard, and her body was restructured by the Red Tide. She seems to have established a special communication with the Punishing Virus by "listening" to its "voice," or imagery, to be precise. Selena can tell if the emotion contained within this "exotic song" is happy or sad, but cannot understand its detailed meanings.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
193	1531003	4	No.004	Constructs are usually made to replicate their human bodies for M.I.N.D. stability, but Selena looks quite different as her M.I.N.D. was shut down for an extensive period and deteriorated significantly to a point that it could hardly keep her original personality. She has been reborn since, and her current body is one that fits her M.I.N.D. the best.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
194	1531003	5	No.005	Selena's M.I.N.D. almost collapsed after her resurrection. An Ascendant helped to stabilize it before she regained control of her own body.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
195	1531003	6	No.006	Mentally, Selena is still somewhat unstable. The past memories are like distant, unreal stories to her, only her pursuit of art and beauty remains unshaken. She is still gentle and kind, but sometimes others may notice a glimpse of solitude and depression.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
196	1121003	1	No.001	BPE-07 Chrome, Tank Construct. The second prototype Construct built under Babylonia's mid-term military Construct development plan. Has a special Inver-Device installed along with other specialized improvements in various aspects. This frame may enter a rapid overclock cooldown mode after running at the maximum power output.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
197	1121003	2	No.002	"I believe this is a solid decision despite it being unconventional." Chrome often has to multi-task as both a fighter and field commander thanks to the specialized Inver-Device and unique duties of Strike Hawk.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
198	1121003	3	No.003	The performance tuning of the new frame is completely determined by Chrome, except the Inver-Device, which was made in a stealth form in the early stage due to a request from John Smith.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
199	1121003	4	No.004	The adaptation of the new frame had gone through incredible difficulties due to its uniqueness. After Chrome was critically injured in a battle against the Ascendant, he chose to deploy the new frame in advance and managed to stabilize the M.I.N.D. under the Gray Raven Commandant's help.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
200	1121003	5	No.005	Compared to before, Chrome is now more determined and confident in his path. He may become a shield, a fortress, a flag, or a bridge, but most importantly a leader.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
201	1121003	6	No.006	Once a "Chief" of F.O.S., he can somewhat relate to the commandant of Gray Raven as he understands the weight of duty as a leader. Trusts the commandant like a close friend but has not realized it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
202	1221002	1	No.001	Designation BPH-22, No. 21: Tank. Originally a Daedalus test subject. While she was still human, due to her poor physical condition, she was dependent on the support of a Medic Bot to do most daily activities. As the 21st test subject, she was the hardest one to modify among her peers. After being recycled by Kurono HQ, due to her special constitution being highly compatible with the Medic Bot, Kurono researchers were inspired to modify it into a Co-Bot for battle. After which, No. 21 became the first Construct to be connected with a mobile machine.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
203	1221002	2	No.002	"Sometimes... I can still smell the disinfectant in the air." No. 21, who spent part of her life as a human in the institute, has never left the lab and knows nothing about human emotions or social structures.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
204	1221002	3	No.003	She believes that her only calling is battle, like an animal bred for the Colosseum. Even though she is trained as a weapon, it isn't easy to make her obey. It has taken a lot of effort to get her to stand among Cerberus and follow orders.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
205	1221002	4	No.004	Due to the particularity of herself and her frame, No. 21 has a unique fighting style. She is fervent and ruthless. Why does she turn into a wild animal in the face of emotionless mechanoids? More data about No. 21 was destroyed during Kurono HQ's recycling operation. One thing is for certain, never let her show her fangs at you.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
206	1221002	5	No.005	No. 21's Co-Bot has a degree of cognition and can share some memory with No. 21. Without each other, neither the Co-Bot nor No. 21 are as a whole. In a way, No. 21 has a bond with her Buddy that most people don't understand. This has also provided some research data for Asimov's CUB Project.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
207	1221002	6	No.006	Keeping only one eye open makes No. 21 even more sensitive. In fact, No. 21 is able to synchronize vision with the Co-Bot at the cost of impairing her own perception. As for what's under the bandage...No one knows.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
208	1131003	1	No.001	This is not Vera's first time using this frame. Before it officially came into service, Vera was already using it in special "assignments" under Commander Nikola's order. Compared with the Support type Rozen, Garnet is a Tank unit and hence is more suitable for solo breakthrough tasks and battles against Constructs.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
209	1131003	2	No.002	"If Death exists to kill, then what is the point of such killing?" Vera's creed is to complete the missions that she must complete and slay the enemies that must be slayed. Only she gets to decide what classifies as "must"—it is her code and her responsibility.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
210	1131003	3	No.003	This frame once used a katana similar to Rozen's as its standard weapon in consideration of Vera's weapon proficiency, but such thin weapons did not go along with the frame's combat style. She later advised to change it into the current signature banner spear.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
211	1131003	4	No.004	"No one is allowed to die as long as my banner is still standing." This banner once existed as a symbol of heroism and the undying hope of the battlefield. The old hero may be gone, but the banner is still standing tall in the very frontline, guiding numerous anonymous heroes in their relentless fighting.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
212	1131003	5	No.005	Many unconventional parts were used in the production of this frame. They did not interfere with regular maintenance, but still caused a lot of concern for Bridget from the Support Force. She always urged Vera to try to avoid injuries—which never worked.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
213	1131003	6	No.006	"Perhaps you are right, that one day our battle will come to an end. Will this pain still be around?" Vera is still haunted by the never-ending agony, which she once relied on solely. But she is also beginning to have hope that she cannot abandon apart from endless fighting and pain.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
214	1541003	1	No.001	Roland was a commoner born during the Golden Age. There are records of him in the form of old movie posters. He used to appear around the world as an "Ascendant."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
215	1541003	2	No.002	As a test subject for early Constructs, Roland's frame performance was not very impressive. This has led him to hone his reflexes and tactical skills in order to compensate for it. These experiences have allowed him to utilize his current frame to the fullest. As for where he got his current frame from, he doesn't seem eager to share.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
216	1541003	3	No.003	Roland is very serious once he decides on a goal, as he will do anything to see it through. No matter what he will sacrifice or what damage it will do to the world, he will not stop until his goal is achieved. This can be seen from all his past confrontations with Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
217	1541003	4	No.004	"The show is about to begin!" Maybe because Roland used to be an actor, his speech is always melodramatic, even when he is alone. It is as if he lives under a perpetual spotlight with cameras locking on to his every move.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
218	1541003	5	No.005	Roland scoffs at grand narratives, but he does applaud those who still possess a strong will and clear goal after knowing the truth. Of course, that doesn't mean he would help them.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
219	1541003	6	No.006	"You have an order for me? It shall be done. Haha, have a little faith in me." Everything Roland does or says always has multiple meanings. One must be careful to weed the truth out of his sea of lies. His true intentions, however, will forever remain a mystery.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
220	1031004	1	No.001	BPN-08. Frame: Empyrea. Type: Amplifier. A brand new specialized frame developed by the Science Council that is capable of "purifying" the Punishing Virus. Theoretically, Empyrea can absorb the Punishing Virus and eliminate it with the Omega Weapon installed within the frame.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
221	1031004	2	No.002	Integrated with the data retrieved from a certain agent, Empyrea has unavoidably inherited some of that agent's traits. As the information recorded in the Punishing Virus would flow into Liv's M.I.N.D. along with the "purification," Liv has virtually experienced the sufferings many people went through during the virus outbreak.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
222	1031004	3	No.003	"...For the good of humanity." After switching her frame, Liv has grown empathy and compassion for all living beings in the world. With her unconditional love, Liv resolves to fight for humanity even if it means sacrificing her own future.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
223	1031004	4	No.004	The wings attached to the frame were Liv's idea. Made of incredibly durable but lightweight materials, those wings are capable of maintaining flying stability when the frame operates at a high power level. They can also form a shield whenever necessary.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
224	1031004	5	No.005	"This is my answer, my choice... I'll never give up." Liv has never regretted the decisions she made. To protect the ones she loves, she has no fear of death or what it may cost to live on. She will keep going with a smile no matter what horrible mirages and migraines await her in the future.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
225	1031004	6	No.006	Just like Liv wields her weapon in hand for the ones she cherishes, there are those who always stand beside her in order to protect her wish. Together they will face the future lying ahead. In the river of memories, Liv has extended her hand toward her own wish.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
226	1531004	1	No.001	Originally designed for Selena, Capriccio used to be a back-up frame that was still in the stage of initial assembly and adaptation. After Selena became M.I.A. in the space station, the development of this frame was halted until later restarted by an artist's request.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
227	1531004	2	No.002	The artist was also personally involved in the frame's exterior design, of which the flower-shaped decoration on its chest became the most unique element. The designer also claimed that part of the design concept came from Selena herself.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
228	1531004	3	No.003	"How I wish... she can see this with her own eyes." Most of Capriccio's data came from a wide-area sound wave detector in Babylonia.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
229	1531004	4	No.004	The detector found a single, moving source that was continuously broadcasting music excerpts that were suspected to be created by Selena. The artist called this source "whale song". It had been constantly moving in a irregular pattern which was extremely difficult to trace.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
230	1531004	5	No.005	As the name suggests, "Capriccio" is a sleeping vessel quietly awaiting its master, but her soul is always living with the whale song on the earth.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
231	1531004	6	No.006	Perhaps one day the wandering whale song will realize that someone has been following her and singing the same songs, then she will know she has never been alone.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
232	1551003	1	No.001	Before she's a Construct, Pulao secretly learned dancing, but she looked "more like an agile martial artist than an elegant dancer." This is where her dance-like attack moves came from.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
233	1551003	2	No.002	"Fuxi told me that Constructs were humans in mechanical bodies... So I guess there must be machines with human minds." In the eyes of young Pulao, machines and mankind are the same in essence, which may be utterly ridiculous but could also be a truth that humans ignore out of arrogance.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
234	1551003	3	No.003	According to Fuxi's research, Dragontoll's frame doesn't have any outstanding designs in terms of strength output, which means Pulao's exceptional strength is completely a result of its creator's delicate frame adjustments and the unique strength techniques in her M.I.N.D.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
235	1551003	4	No.004	Normally, Pulao doesn't carry weapons in combat as she doesn't want to use her full force. The reason why she selects Dragon Axe as her weapon is because it is heavy enough and won't fly too far away even if it slips out of her hands.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
236	1551003	5	No.005	Although Pulao doesn't remember anything before the Nighter, she knows that it must be a precious memory. She also believes that what she has got at the cost of it must be something that's even more valuable.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
237	1551003	6	No.006	"Although I barely understand what value is, I want to protect those who are in pursuit of it and everything they cherish." People always spend their life searching for their own value, which gives value to the process itself. What happened on the Nighter may have already become "Pulao's" value.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
238	1051004	1	No.001	Like her last frame, Nanami designed and built this new one herself as well. It has drawn the attention of the Science Council with its many unknown technologies, especially the mech she calls "Power". The Science Council has tried to dissemble it for research—but all their requests have been rejected immediately for strange reasons.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
239	1051004	2	No.002	"Nanami has Power... to travel everywhere! We'll go to a new place soon... Fly me to the moon!" Nanami loves traveling, not just because she gets to explore the unknown "there" but because it also gives her new perspectives about "here."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
240	1051004	3	No.003	"Such excessive firepower in one frame... What kind of things was it designed to fight?" Having obtained rare footage of Starfarer in battle, Asimov still has no idea what the designer was thinking. Starfarer is extremely intricate... and equally mad.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
241	1051004	4	No.004	Nanami loves the Golden Age entertainment humans made called "video games." They contain adventures she has never encountered and ideas she has never seen, and within them, there are infinite possible futures and worlds... Although every game comes to an end eventually, Nanami always tries to get the good ending.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
242	1051004	5	No.005	A unique being, Nanami is the "Sagemachina" that supposes to awaken other machines. But no one ever asks what the girl truly wanted before she became the sage.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
243	1051004	6	No.006	"Yeah! Nanami wants to be friends with everyone... but what is a friend? Can you tell me, Commandant?" With no clear definitions—perhaps all it takes is hands held, laughter shared, shoulders lent... or even a short path together walked—Nanami has long been everyone's friend.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
244	1561003	1	No.001	Designation MPA-01, officially known as Heuristic Artificial Intelligence Caretaking Machine-Alpha. Serving as the administrative AI of the machine consciousness experiment, Haicma's main program was once installed in a mainframe computer at the Machine Consciousness Experiment Research Institute of the original Science Council for recording and analyzing the experiment process.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
245	1561003	2	No.002	Among all the experimental subjects in the machine consciousness experiment, there was a special one named Nanami. She gave Haicma a name that only belonged to her and extended an invitation to "become friends" that no other machines had ever done before. Under Nanami's guidance, Haicma developed self-awareness for the first time. In a sense, Haicma is the first mechanoid influenced by "Sagemachina".	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
246	1561003	3	No.003	"I will find her." After obtaining a new body and mission, Haicma embarked on a journey to find Nanami. Along her journey, Haicma encountered different machines and learned about the existence of "Sage" through their beliefs. Little does she know that when she meets the girl from her memories again, the girl will have already become "Sagemachina" that is believed to save each and every machine.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
247	1561003	4	No.004	"I believe you are aware that I can simulate most personalities within human definitions." In order to optimize experiment recording, the administrative AI's emotion module has hundreds of personality types installed, and its simulation and computing capability can perfectly harness any human personality. However, Haicma would often rather communicate through her own "perception" and "thinking" than rely on this function.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
248	1561003	5	No.005	Although Haicma understands the objective definition of all emotions, she has never thought that she has genuine emotions like humans. Aware of her mechanical nature, she realizes that her emotions are a product of the emotion module's simulation, yet she will subconsciously store up those indescribable feelings and pursue anything about humans that can arouse unique emotions and create a "miracle" itself.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
249	1561003	6	No.006	"Information is a cradle for a machine's self-awareness. However, facing a future that falls beyond computing power, I... What should Haicma do?" A machine's thinking revolves around taking "rational" rather than "desired" action. Haicma realizes this is the difference between herself and Sage. She wants to find the answer to this question—even though her functions may terminate long before she reaches that singularity, she believes she has already taken the first step.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
250	1071004	1	No.001	Unlike most Engineering Force frames, Karenina opts for a design that features higher power output and a more durable internal structure rather than a design convenient for precision maneuverability. "With determination, precision maneuverability can be easily achieved, but power output is different. You can't make up for it." Although it sounds like a forced argument, no Engineering Force members object to this in word or heart.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
251	1071004	2	No.002	Few people know that in addition to engineering projects, Karenina also has expertise in frame design for Constructs. However, she was not accepted into any of the frame design organizations mainly because her designs "required a high budget" or "had unnecessary high performance." The reason behind such designs is that Karenina is always prepared to fight in the most dangerous places.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
252	1071004	3	No.003	The Engineering Force can be roughly divided into two parts—the maintenance team in charge of Babylonia maintenance and the reconstruction team that works on the reconstruction projects on the surface. The first mission Karenina received after joining the Engineering Force was to rebuild the ruins in an area, where the slums she and her grandfather once lived in happened to be. To reduce the tragedies of the Corrupted attacking human settlements, after becoming the captain, Karenina chose not to stay in Babylonia like her predecessors but to travel frequently between the two teams.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
253	1071004	4	No.004	Even though Karenina does not fight on the frontlines as often as the Task Force members, she is always searching for a glimmer of hope on the battlefield of technology. Fortunately, Karenina is never alone in this fight. She races against time with her "warriors." Battling difficulties is her responsibility as the captain and her source of pride.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
254	1071004	5	No.005	"Destruction is not an end, it's a means." Karenina doesn't take pleasure in destroying things for the sake of it. In fact, she approaches it with great caution. Once she determines that destruction is necessary, she will completely destroy her target in order to rebuild a beautiful new world in its place.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
255	1071004	6	No.006	On the path to the future, hope always appears in her sight. Karenina is never short of the courage to seize hope despite struggles, and this bravery has propelled her forward. Now, she has gained another kind of courage and confidence—the courage to destroy the hope in her hands, and the confidence to rebuild it anew.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
256	1571003	1	No.001	When Noan first showed up, Babylonia realized that the Ascendants had the power to turn humans into Constructs. Babylonia has been keeping a close eye on Noan because of his involvement with the Ascendants, but he never complains about it or the examinations he has to go through. Most of the people who know it keep a distance from him and are always carefully polite toward him, which makes Noan a little sad.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
257	1571003	2	No.002	Arca is the name Noan picked for his frame. It comes from a poem that a young Construct told Noan after he left Asslam: We are on an ark adrift upon a river's flow; When time comes, we shall disembark for a new ark though. He will start a new journey that lasts until the end of his life.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
258	1571003	3	No.003	After trying out the coating, he seriously considered dying his hair rainbow, but it was turned down by all Dark Aries members. Allen, chairman of WGAA, said it was an "abstract expression." Still, he left a few locks of hair white as a final struggle.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
259	1571003	4	No.004	He can write and use weapons with either hand. He is not good at using heavy weapons, but it's not because of a lack of strength. He is just used to an agile fighting style. The blueprint of the Rev Blade was Rachel's gift for Noan's 17th birthday, while his offhand weapon is a blade that he has been using since he joined the Cargo Crew. Before he got the Rev Blade, Noan used to fight with a gun and a blade.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
260	1571003	5	No.005	He is not good at ranged weapons. Though no stranger to guns, he is far from a sharpshooter. However, sometimes he can accidentally hit things that are relevant. Once during a fight, one of his bullets went through three windows and hit a sign board on the opposite building, which fell down on the leader of a gang of robbers.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
261	1571003	6	No.006	He broke free from the interference and hallucination created by the Ascendants on his own. After further examinations, his M.I.N.D. was deemed stable enough to adapt to specialized frames. Whether this is a quality that Noan possesses naturally or the result of the interference of the Ascendants, the Science Council has yet come to a conclusion.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
262	1041004	1	No.001	A specialized frame based on the integrated results of Babylonia's years of research. It was officially employed for an investigation mission at the Copperfield Aquarium. Because this frame's original first candidate was not Bianca, it has undergone various readjustments and eventually become what it is today.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
263	1041004	2	No.002	In order to restrain M.I.N.D. deviation inflicted by using the Phantom Tracer, it requires a Deep M.I.N.D. connection with a commandant who has a determined Mind Beacon. When Bianca was inquired about her thoughts, the name of Gray Raven's commandant came out of her almost unequivocally.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
264	1041004	3	No.003	The equipped Swordstaff can synergize with the Phantom Tracer to produce astonishing energy output. As it is a weapon created specifically for Stigmata, its theoretical uniqueness has excluded all other Omniframes from wielding it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
265	1041004	4	No.004	On the face of it, this frame's armor has been lightened to increase its agility; the truth is, because of Kurono's unparalleled technology, its durability does not even pale in comparison with Tank Construct's. After Bianca's own adjustments, it is able to unleash its power to the fullest in any extreme environment.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
266	1041004	5	No.005	Because it is equipped with the Phantom Tracer, which is built upon Mother's tissue, Kurono once predicted that Bianca would need at least a few months to stabilize the accompanying M.I.N.D. deviation. Bianca, however, fully adapted to Stigmata's side effects just in a matter of days. According to her words, she has long been used to an "unconventional" frame like this.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
267	1041004	6	No.006	A "witch." Before Bianca was turned into a Construct, it was what she was being called by those who were afraid of her. Nevertheless, she has never considered being dubbed a "witch" to be derogation. She believes there must be something in this world so heinous that only a "witch" can destroy it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
