1550312	1551003	1	1	8	Dragontoll's Secret 12	Pulao often requires herself to act like a "grown-up," but sometimes she seems to unconsciously reveal the child aspect of her when she is with the Babylonia commandant.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1050401	1051004	1	1	2	Starfarer's Secret 1	Nanami has planned a large number of adornments for her new frame, but because she has to travel in the data ocean, she made adjustments after Gestalt said they "take up valuable processing power."		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1050402	1051004	1	1	2	Starfarer's Secret 2	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—First Law: Nanami loves humans! So, no one is allowed to hurt humans.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1050403	1051004	1	1	3	Starfarer's Secret 3	Her frame gives her even more mobility—you can expect to find her snooping around all kinds of nooks and corners, air ducts, cardboard boxes, and undeployed machines...		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050404	1051004	1	1	3	Starfarer's Secret 4	Nanami loves to test the limit of Power's strength. Knowing that, the Engineering Force often challenges Nanami to get Power to cut materials that are normally hard to obtain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050405	1051004	1	1	4	Starfarer's Secret 5	Nanami loves the elevated view she gets on top of Power, but sometimes she will get too excited and forget Babylonia's height limit, hitting her head.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1050406	1051004	1	1	4	Starfarer's Secret 6	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Second Law: Nanami is free, so Nanami does not follow orders she doesn't like! Even if it is fate itself!		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1050407	1051004	1	1	5	Starfarer's Secret 7	System Announcement: Nanami is holding a contest for "Power's Perfect Pose", so don't forget to take a photo of them when you see them pass by! Sign up at the Gray Raven Commandant's room.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1050408	1051004	1	1	5	Starfarer's Secret 8	Nanami and Power's thoughts are linked. With just a thought, she can send Power into battle without being in the cockpit—at the expense of accuracy.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1050409	1051004	1	1	6	Starfarer's Secret 9	Power's full name is "Paradigmatic Omnipotent Weapon-Edge Remake".		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1050410	1051004	1	1	6	Starfarer's Secret 10	Power's design is based on the shape of robotic soldiers in one of the possible futures, enhanced with armaments inspired by mechs in Golden Age anime.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1050411	1051004	1	1	7	Starfarer's Secret 11	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Third Law: Nanami must live to find the only correct answer! That is how she can stay with her beloved friends.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1050412	1051004	1	1	8	Starfarer's Secret 12	The "Three Laws of Nanami"—Zeroth Law: Perhaps Commandant has to choose a future without Nanami one day. Still, Nanami will continue to love humans and Commandant. This is her promise to herself.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1560301	1561003	1	1	2	Starveil's Secret 1	According to Haicma's calculations, the fastest runner in human history is Kuafu whose speed exceeds 1,668km/h in order to see the sun 24 hours a day.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1560302	1561003	1	1	2	Starveil's Secret 2	Back in the early days when she was free from control, Haicma was struggling to distinguish between human legends and historical facts. As a result, it often appeared to her that mankind had experienced a significant physical decline, such as a loss of the ability to shoot fireballs from their palms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1560303	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 3	Haicma knows a technique called "divination" in which humans foretell the future with card arrangements; however, even with all of her computing power, she cannot prove its validity.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560304	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 4	Haicma's old-fashioned hat was originally worn to cover up a damaged component, but she decided to keep it even after the component was mended. It has become her routine to clean and repair this hat, and the reason for it is that a gear covering her head makes her feel "secure." She values the emotional connection brought by a particular item more than its necessity.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560305	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 5	Haicma excels in making puns, and she will explain her puns whenever necessary. The statement "excels in making puns" is based on the fact that she has a success rate of 89% in making her listeners laugh, which is truly impressive even though more than 50% of successful cases are not due to the pun itself.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560306	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 6	Haicma's composed exterior can be deceiving at times because she can maintain an impassive expression even when a storm is raging in her mind.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560307	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 7	Haicma's thinking is the result of precise calculations. Therefore, she often feels perplexed when a situation exceeds her expectations, but this is not a kind of feeling she hates.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560308	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 8	At first, Haicma wielded her scythe strictly adhering to the tactical movements in her database that include many subtleties like the angles and amount of force applied; yet, she soon discovered that adding certain variations to the tactical movements could increase combat efficiency by nearly 20%... It took a long time before she recovered from such an astonishment.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560309	1561003	1	1	6	Starveil's Secret 9	Haicma's database contains a wealth of information on domestic services, which theoretically qualifies her as an expert in child care. But when it comes to real life, she has failed a lot due to her over-reliance on those theories.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1560310	1561003	1	1	6	Starveil's Secret 10	Haicma once stood motionless in the middle of a road for an entire day just because she did not want to disturb a bird that had landed on her head.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1560311	1561003	1	1	7	Starveil's Secret 11	In addition to imitating human sleep, Haicma also tried to kick a drink can the way humans did, and the can ended up going straight through a rusty trash bin.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1560312	1561003	1	1	8	Starveil's Secret 12	Haicma's frame was prepared by a researcher. Because she obtained this frame without knowing it at all, she has yet to fully understand its every function. For example, she just discovered that she can pull a never-ending string of colorful flags out from the joints of her arms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1070401	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 1	At the beginning of the modification, she didn't expect Kurono would accept all her outrageous demands. And as a result, the backup plan she prepared was never used.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1070402	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 2	The only design proposal rejected was the one created based on her personal preference—an Inver-Device that is twice as large as the current one. The argument was settled with Karenina's compromise, after the person showed her a scenario where the wearer had to crouch down to pass through the doorway after installing the Inver-Device.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1070403	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 3	Members of the Engineering Force can hear their captain and vice-captain arguing almost every day. Although it sounds like Karenina is winning, Teddy is also impeccable. Currently, Karenina's win-loss ratio against Teddy is 126:382.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1070404	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 4	Even in Babylonia, people like Karenina who have pursued education after becoming Constructs were very rare, not to mention that she graduated with the highest score among all students in her major.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1070405	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 5	During her study, Karenina tried learning musical instruments and eventually chose to learn the drums. Her vocal teacher at the time described the sound as "the beats that strike the soul" and soon after that, advised her to quit in a gentle manner.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1070406	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 6	To adapt to the new combat style, Karenina has to go through high-intensity zero-gravity and hyper-gravity training every day. The biggest struggle to overcome is to avoid being hit by her two ponytails in the face during the spin.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1070407	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 7	The Blast Hammer was intentionally designed to retain the capability of launching projectiles, so that Karenina can still "bring back her good old days" from time to time. As her shooting targets are usually the ruins that need to be demolished, this leisure activity of hers has actually saved a large amount of money that would otherwise be spent on demolition machinery.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070408	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 8	Due to the slight difference between the simulated gravity on the Moon and Babylonia, Karenina often hit the ceiling for exerting too much force when she first arrived on the Moon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070409	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 9	When Karenina was back to Babylonia, it took her some time to get used to the simulated gravity there. She acted gently even when walking. Surprised by her overly delicate movements, members suggested her to get more rest.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070410	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 10	For a long time, Karenina didn't understand why people kept looking at the top of her head while talking to her, until the Gray Raven Commandant explained that her Inver-Device shook back and forth when she talked.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070411	1071004	1	1	7	Scire's Secret 11	Karenina seems to become more "candid" than before. When Bianca pointed this out with relief, Karenina explained that it was only a self-abandonment behavior because she couldn't turn off the emotional perception function of her Inver-Device.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1070412	1071004	1	1	8	Scire's Secret 12	Tip for getting leave approved in the Engineering Force: Leave applications have at least 30% more chance to be approved when Gray Raven's Commandant is at the Engineering Force. —Teddy		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1570301	1571003	1	1	2	Arca's Secret 1	When he was a kid, he read a lot of mangas in the book storage room, and there were quite some weird ones among them. As a result, he can enjoy all kinds of books, especially those recommended by his comrades. He will make sure to finish them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1570302	1571003	1	1	2	Arca's Secret 2	He once left a manga in City 075 in order to make room for supplies in his bag. While investigating the place, Gray Raven found the book, which had a pear blossom between the pages. Later, he retrieved the book, but lost it again when he was severely injured in City 210.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1570303	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 3	Noan still dreams of his past from time to time. Now he can become aware of the dream and wake up, because the clockwork firefly is always intact in the dream.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570304	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 4	He has lost count of the skills he learned in the past in order to survive. There is one thing he isn't good at, though, which is cooking. That's because he didn't have the chance to cook before he became a Construct. Now he can make decent food as long as there is a recipe to follow. Sometimes he still tries to eat the offcut ingredients, because he thinks throwing them away is a waste.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570305	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 5	Whenever he doesn't know what to say, he'd start to tell weird jokes with a perfectly straight face. Most of the time people think he is being serious, because he definitely looks it. Before he begins, Noan would always say "Let me tell you a secret." If the listener takes it, though, he'll start to explain. That is, if he still has the chance.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570306	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 6	His comrades from the Cargo Crew used to say he was very good at consoling people. As a result, he was often asked to talk with others over a drink. Noan doesn't drink. He doesn't even like the smell of alcohol and tobacco. Still, he won't leave someone who needs help and company alone.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570307	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 7	He doesn't know how to react to tears, nor can he tell if someone is faking crying. Whenever someone cries, he gets very nervous, even though he manages to maintain a straight face. He also tends to say yes to things he usually wouldn't at such times.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570308	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 8	If there is an afterlife, Noan wants to be a seagull. Actually, he had never seen the sea or a seagull before he became a Construct.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570309	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 9	He was known to be a stubborn kid on Commoner Carriage N before the age of thirteen. A few reckless rebellions earned him the nickname "prickly chestnut" behind his back. However, since he never had the chance to see chestnut shells or anyone getting injured from picking chestnuts, he didn't realize the nickname was meant for him at all.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570310	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 10	Noan doesn't really have a preference for colors, but he does like things that are white and pure, like white fabrics, white feathers, clouds on a sunny day, clean paper... The only white thing he doesn't like is snow, especially a snowy field that stretches beyond the horizon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570311	1571003	1	1	7	Arca's Secret 11	He has a friendly personality. He used to have a lot of friends when he was a human, but only really connected with a few of them. He tends to be slow and reluctant to react to people. Most of the time he won't open up until he has known someone for a long while. He'll only want to get closer to someone when he becomes familiar with them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1570312	1571003	1	1	8	Arca's Secret 12	He tells his true feelings to those who he feels close to. When he realizes that certain things he says will cause them to react in a funny way, he'd occasionally make fun of them on purpose. He is aware that he is still a kid deep inside, but he doesn't intend to pretend otherwise in front of his friends.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1040401	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 1	Because Stigmata's appearance and specifications are much different from Zero's, when Bianca first appeared before the Purifying Force in this frame, some members did not even recognize her as their captain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040402	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 2	When Bianca was appointed as the captain of the Purifying Force, most of the members were displeased. But after she "courteously" invited all members to spend one day with her in the training room, all doubts and gloom disappeared as if they had never existed.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040403	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 3	Fond of reading and studying literature, Bianca once had an enthusiasm for creating a movie script sparked in her mind. However, it quickly cooled off when she could not think up a name for her movie. To this day, that ambition still resides in a little corner of her heart.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040404	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 4	Chiko once said that Bianca "has ferocious aggressiveness deep within her heart." It left Bianca completely bewildered, but no matter how hard she pressed for an explanation, Chiko never revealed the reasons behind her judgment.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040405	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 5	The head-mounted Inver-Device is specially devised to operate with the Phantom Tracer, which can most accurately detect and capture the Punishing Virus residuals. Although it appears to have rotatable joints, it actually cannot be rotated.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040406	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 6	In order to enhance the "lamp-like" feeling, the Phantom Tracer is equipped with a lighting function. However, because Mother's tissue sealed inside will also emit an apparitional light when this function is activated, Bianca has avoided using it to prevent unnecessary anxiety.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040407	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 7	Bianca's biggest interest is watching movies. There are even display cabinets in her personal dorm specifically for classic literary movie discs that she spent most of her salary on. After switching into Stigmata, she has become hooked on knight-themed fantasy movies from the Golden Age.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040408	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 8	The Swordstaff was originally called "Black Excalibur" in its designer's personal file before being finalized as "Hecate". As it was too different from Bianca's style, Bianca rejected it once it was proposed.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040409	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 9	Perhaps not many people noticed it, but Bianca and Chiko were actually good friends. They once went to the movies together on their day off in Babylonia, but had a big disagreement over whether to watch a romance or a spy movie.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040410	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 10	Bianca was once ridiculed as a "half-baked captain" within the Purifying Force. In order to fortify Bianca's leadership, Chiko did many things with great effort behind the scenes, but the two of them never spoke about it even though Bianca was aware of what Chiko had done.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040411	1041004	1	1	7	Stigmata's Secret 11	Karenina once strongly demanded an investigation into the structural and safety issues of the Phantom Tracer as she was concerned that it would inflict irreversible damage on Bianca's M.I.N.D. After facing repeated harsh rejections from Kurono, Bianca spent a long time reassuring Karenina not to worry about her.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1040412	1041004	1	1	8	Stigmata's Secret 12	Due to the different natures of the Purifying Force and the Task Force, Bianca did not share much time with the commandant of Gray Raven. Naturally, before their first Deep M.I.N.D. connection, Gray Raven's commandant was worried that their connection would be unstable, but it turned out they achieved a high and stable sync rate every time they established a Deep M.I.N.D. connection.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>
