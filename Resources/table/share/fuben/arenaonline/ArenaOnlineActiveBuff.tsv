Inver-Sync	\n\nSynchronization is activated when there are at least 2 <color=#0F70BC>default B/A-rank Constructs</color> in the co-op team, significantly boosting the abilities of <color=#0F70BC>default B/A-rank Constructs.</color>\n\nBabylonia developed this new technology in order to enhance the power of Constructs by sharing the abilities and minds of connected Constructs within the region. To activate Inver-Sync, sync modules must be installed on the Construct frames. Tech departments often put these modules on secondary combat units to reduce the risk of damage.	80001
