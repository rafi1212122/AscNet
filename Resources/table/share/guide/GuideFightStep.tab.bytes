102030308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Commandant? You're all trying to steal my Commandant?!

102030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We need to get out of here. Hold on, Lee!

102030405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Quickly, before she notices us!	
102030406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Ugh!	
102030407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee! Are you okay?	
102030408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The wound is worsening... Just leave me here. I'll just slow you down.	
102030409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Recalling is the safest choice for me now. It will only cause the faintest ripple in my M.I.N.D.	
102030410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, please! Stop!

102040103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We should investigate, Commandant.	
102040104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Already sent someone, huh.	
102040201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's too much debris. Is there another way?	
102040202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is the last exit. All the others have collapsed.	
102040203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's no choice, Commandant. We'll have to slowly remove the debris.	
102040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	You will all be specimens of my next experiment!	
102040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't hesitate just because she was a Construct!	
102040303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Do... Do we destroy her?!	
102040304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Yes.	
102040305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Impossible! How are you so strong?!	
102040306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	A Construct without their Commandant is no match for us!

102040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's use the fog to sneak back upstairs.	
102040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This enemy is bad news... Sorry. I'm being a liability.	
102040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No, Lee... You're not.	
102040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm the one who got us into this mess...	
102040405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Coughs) It's getting worse... Just put me down...

102040408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll bring you back, no matter what!

102040410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...Alright, then I'll be counting on you.	
102040411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Corrupted are closing in. We need to hurry.	
103010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Kamui, what's your status?	
103010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Uh, Chrome... I think I'm lost.	
103010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Just as I thought...	
103010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	You're good in a fight, but your sense of direction is appalling...	
103010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Listen up, Kamui, just follow the Navi-Path...	
103010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Navi? I told you, that thing is useless. It keeps changing directions! It's so annoying...!	
103010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Because it detects threats in real-time and adjusts your route accordingly. The Strike Hawks fight alone, after all.	
103010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've got my instincts! I don't need a Navi to tell me where the danger is!	
103010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hang on. There's a Construct up ahead. I'll go ask him the way!	
103010110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	But there are no friendly signals in your vicinity. Hey! Can you still hear me?	
103010111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	You here on a mission too? Well, ain't that a coincidence!	
103010112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
103010113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes. Quite.	
103010114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'm looking for the Estate Museum. On my way to reinforce the Gray Raven. Can you point me in the right direction?	
103010115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That way.	
103010116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Oh, it's that way... Guess my Navi was right, after all. Good luck on your mission too, friend!	
103010117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't mention it.	
103010118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Well, well. They do have some interesting people on their side, don't they?	
103010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is where the distress signal originated.	
103010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	High Construct casualties, but low levels of Punishing Virus...	
103010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thankfully, they all recalled their consciousnesses. Their bodies weren't further infected as well.	
103010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We should do some preliminary recovery, and find out what happened while we're at it.	
103010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They are covered in gunshot wounds.	
103010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whatever did this is packing some serious heat. Be on your guard.	
103010207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Look!	
103010208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Heavy Terrapod	1	Visitor Identification: Thug. Commence program, "Civil Control".	
103010209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's... one of the Estate Terrapods. Someone must have reactivated it.	
103010210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How many guns did they cram in this thing? Post-Pandemic Age tech really could use some subtlety...	
103010211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, request backup from nearby team.	
103010212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay!	
103010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Leave these to me!	
103010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Easy!	
103010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wow, he must be a Tank Construct... That onslaught didn't leave a scratch on him.	
103010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	(Chuckles)	
103010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate structures are falling apart, but their control systems seem pretty much intact.	
103010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate control systems can be accessed via that Terminal. If we can hack the defense codes, we can shut the systems down.	
103010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is that a bionic animal? Cooool!	
103010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wow! It's moving!	
103010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You‚Äî	
103010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He's activated the entire museum security system! And it's at the highest alert! That idiot...	
103020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These exhibits... look super shady...	
103020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I won't touch them again, I swear!	
103020103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Locked... Tch, of course.	
103020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Enemies behind us are closing in!	
103020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No good way around this. Let's deal with them first.	
103020106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	???	1	That's far enough. Please leave this place, while you still can.	
103020107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Who... said that?	
103020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The... the exhibits are being activated!	
103020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Turn on EM Camo, quickly.	
103020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Beamers ahead are hidden behind a force field. Our attacks will bounce right off.	
103020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We'll have to observe their attacks and time our exit carefully. Remember, any hits will disable our EM Camo.	
103020205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door locks disabled. Let's keep going.	
103020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Some sort of barrier is blocking access to the courtyard...	
103020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There's a high Punishing Virus response... behind the force field.	
103020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It must be some kind of lair.	
103020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	It is intended to protect you... This is your last chance...	
103020305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	Once you pass through this barrier, there's no turning back.	
103020306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv, insert your Levi-Gun core into the Terminal. It will short the force field.	
103020307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On it.	
103020308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
103020309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The force field has been overloaded. We can continue on our way!	
103020310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go.	
103020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The fighting there is done. We don't have to rush. Let's clear out the Corrupted nearby first.	
103030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Phew‚Äîmission accomplished.	
103030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Very thorough. Thank you, Lucia.	
103030201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those Constructs... look a bit abnormal...	
103030202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Their limbs and Inver-Devices are all destroyed, but they've still got vital signs.	
103030203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay...	
103030204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What happened to you? What are you trying to say?	
103030205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay... back...	
103030206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Someone installed Motion Bombs inside them!	
103030207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That's so... messed... up...	
103030208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Disarming these bombs isn't possible right now... We can only give them a bit of distance...	
103030209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	That's what happens when you oppose the Ascendants‚ÄîI do not wish to see it happen anymore.

103030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Loyal old Android. He has defended the Estate Museum for a very long time.	
103030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It would have ended quite differently if he had just succumbed to the power of Ascnet.	
103030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	But, such is the fate of the weak.	
103030304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Go. Complete your final task.	
103030305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Thank you for releasing me...	
103030306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I... will not allow... them... to defile Mr. Copperfield's legacy...

103030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What?	
103030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Now show me what you can do.	
103030404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
103030405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I don't mind if the others join in, but in the end... only one of you will remain.	
103030406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	One of... us?	
103030407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which one will it be?	
103030408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You're weak... just like she said.

104010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You found the monitors?	
104010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Yeah... but any equipment exposed to the elements could have been infected.	
104010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hope they still work. Let me try!	
104010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They seem to be working. It must be my lucky day.	
104010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We should bring them in for analysis.	
104010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to find somewhere quiet. The battlefield isn't the place for computational work.

104010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's at 20% power. If we're doing something, now would be the time...

104020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In and out. Find a supply point for Commandant.	
104020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Target sighted! Wow... it looks a lot bigger in real life. What's it called again?	
104020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Vassago, a kind of bionic Sand Worm. It moves through the sand and ambushes its prey.	
104020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Remain vigilant. We don't have much experience in this kind of environment.	
104020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Did you feel that, Lee?	
104020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes. EM Camo. The enemy's using military-grade tech.	
104020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They could attack from any direction. Watch your back.	
104020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Identifying target code... BPO-29, status... Deserter?

104020306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	???	1	Looks like... you aren't with the cleaners.	
104020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui, don't rush in!	
104020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Worry not! This is the part I'm actually good at!	
104020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't like that... I'm getting used to his style somehow...	
104020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Status update?	
104020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...And they didn't even clear out the Corrupted here before telling us to set up a supply point?	
104020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Whatever. More fun for me!	
104030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This place will be easy to defend.	
104030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Why do we have to do all the fighting? Are they afraid or something?	
104030103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We've got no choice. They're in charge of transport.

104030203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll get you!	
104030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui is fighting his own battle. Lee, I need you to take care of fire support. Hurry!	
104030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forget about those Corrupted! We've got to get Liv back!

104040102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No. I'm sure it'll be fine.

104040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Surrender! I'm not going to kill any Constructs.	
104040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I refuse!	
104040401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Watanabe can take care of Liv for us.	
104040402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Maybe we should put some distance between us and the enemy, Commandant.	
104040403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
104040404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll stop 'em. You get Lee out of here, Commandant!	
105010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We need to move fast. I just hope Kamui's map is accurate...	
105010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't make too much noise. We don't want to alert the Forsaken. They're still holding Liv...	
105010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This facility is probably rigged. Stay sharp...	
105010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee? Kamui?!	
105010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is it?	
105010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gone...?	
105010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Visual system errors? Disorder in the M.I.N.D.?	
105010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted signals have recovered. We'll have to fight... It won't hurt them, will it?	
105010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The next batch of projectors is in position.	
105010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Follow my mark.	
105010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Graviton detector imaging has commenced. The image is fuzzy, but will suffice.	
105010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But these Corrupted aren't projections.	
105010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	How did the Forsaken get through here with no Graviton Detectors?	
105010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I guess they know this place... Why else would they bring Liv here straight?	
105020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we want the EMP to affect the maximum number of projectors, we need to find the best spot.	
105020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's Corrupted everywhere. I'll send a signal when the coast is clear.	
105020103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted attacks are slowing...	
105020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	NOW!!!	
105020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay.	
105020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You said to not let Kamui out of our sights. Is there something?	
105020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, seeing how we're on the dedicated Gray Raven channel...	
105020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I was just checking Kamui's Inver-Device...	
105020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It was running on high-load mode. And there are logs of him trying to turn off his GPS and Comms systems.	
105020205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Turning off his own...	
105020206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He might have his own plans... but I think we definitely need to check in with him more.	
105020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Corrupted are shielding the projectors...	
105020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The one in the middle seems different. I think it must hold the secret to this place.	
105020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Okay, here goes!	
105020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commencing capture of next target.	
105020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Kamui, don't damage its memory shell.	
105020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Haha, as long as I don't hit him directly, he'll be fine...	
105020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Done‚Äîover to you, Lee.	
105030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Show Nanami the M.I.N.D. or you'll regret it‚Äî

105030104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Pffft! This is boring!	
105030105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami's had enough.	
105030201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This place looks quite oriental. It takes me back...

105030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're in Liv's M.I.N.D. She's already showing signs of the Punishing Virus.	
105030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch. That Watanabe... He best get ready for a beating after this...	
105030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv!	
105030401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't hold back, Lucia! We might not get another chance!	
105030402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	(Deep breaths) Very well...	
105030403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv...	
106010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We're on top of Underground Refugee City 019. During the Post-Pandemic Age it was home to half a million refugees.	
106010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	That's about one-third of Babylonia's current population. Of course, it all ended in tragedy.	
106010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Corpses are piled high at the exits... indicating the severity of the final crisis that erupted inside...	
106010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our objective is the Ascendants. Let the archeologists take care of history.	
106010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait. Something's climbing up under the elevator!	
106010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Finally, some movement.	
106010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The door's open.	
106010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We need to cross the walkway to keep moving down.	
106010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hurry. We don't want to get caught out on a bridge.	
106010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Haha! Lucia knows her away around a battlefield!	
106010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Everyone, I've picked up... a familiar signal.	
106010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Executing purification mission, target: Forsaken...	
106010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That Corrupted used to be... a giant omni-directional mobility firefighting device...	
106010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So what you're saying is... it knows hydro-pump!	
106010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey. Why have we got fewer Corrupted than the Forsaken? You been slacking off or something?	
106010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's not a competition...	
106010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Snap out of it, Nanami. You helping or not?	
106010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	I'm waiting!

106020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We can deal with Kamui later. Our top priority is clearing the path ahead.

106020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Then he's bound to come to "her" attention...	
106020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I know full well how that's like.

302010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They must be the "Mechanoid Guards" Browning described.

302010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I dug them up and compared their chassis numbers. They're Goldfinch units.

302010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But we've got to stop it emitting that distress signal.	
302010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They just keep coming! There's no time! Take it down, Commandant!

302010701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So the Mechanoid Guards were using these secret tunnels for rapid deployment.	
302010702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The tunnels are covered in tin, blocking electrical signals of any forces moving through them.

302010704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You sneak along behind me and never show yourself. I almost thought you were being shy.	
302010705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	I've decided. You must be a slave.	
302010706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	The Queen... needs me...	
302010707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She has the ability to overpower me... so why is she running?	
302010801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Fighting on constricted terrain eliminates the enemy's numerical advantage.	
302010802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But it doesn't leave much space for evasion.	
302010803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, Lee and I aren't in very good shape. For this battle, you'll need to access Construct operating systems.	
302010804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lower performance could cause Dodge lag and other problems. I'd feel better if you had access.	
302010805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If you don't mind, Commandant...	
302010806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	My dream... is over...

302011003	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guards have been pushed back. Browning, is everything okay?	
302011004	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Don't come over here!	
302011101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Huh? The combat system has security measures...?	
302011102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Why didn't Browning mention it...?	
302011103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stay calm, Liv... I need to beat them to change the energy protocols.	
302011104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...How?!! There are no energy protocols! It's a dummy system!	
302020101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards... If you can't fix the defense systems, get over here! I'm in trouble!	
302020102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'll just grab one to examine.	
302020103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So the siren has three alarms.	
302020104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The first two alert the guards. The third one goes to a proxy terminal.	
302020105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	This thing is basically useless now.	
302020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Why are they all kneeling here?	
302020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	... Besides the battle damage, they're in pretty good shape.	
302020203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	More guards... They just never end.	
302020204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Goldfinch, can your people still fight?	
302020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I win, you have to come clean with me.	
302020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Not gonna happen, because I'm not losing.	
302020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards...	
302020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Let bygones be bygones. I won't follow you anymore. We should go our separate ways.	
302020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	If I'm not mistaken, these engines drive those artificial sandstorms around the Golden Vortex.	
302020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But it stands to reason there must be more engines to generate so many sand storms.	
302020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	My people... probably aren't trapped here.	
302020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I've been spotted! Better deal with these guys first...	
302020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Did someone rob a bank? This place is crawling with guards.	
302020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Better rush over, just in case.	
302020501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I'm standing right in front of them and still nothing? Maybe these Mechanoids aren't guards after all.	
302020502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Looks like they've got some kind of golden ring marked on them... Hard to tell what it is.	
302020503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	What's that sound...? It's been ringing for ages...

302030504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Channel 1 restored in one go... Luck is on my side.

302030604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Must have them all collapse... on the air outlets...	
302030605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Then their mobility will be limited... after Nithart reconnects to them.

302030607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That's right... Seems like only a few of them can be reconnected.

302030705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	We can't... There's an extract permission, and we only... have two chances...	
302030706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Also, some of the blueprints are fake...	
302030707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What if... we extract the fake one?

302040505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's the last...	
302040506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Destroy her! This is an order from the Queen! Destroy her!	
302040601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The virus has damaged the security process of the energy system. Our hacking is going well so far!	
302040602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Implant the "anti-virus programs"...	
302040603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	If we're able to send these anti-virus programs to the corrupted zone, the infection speed will be greatly slowed down...	
302040604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've already defeated two Corrupted outside...	
302040605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Keep pushing! Don't lose to "yourself," Kamui!	
302040606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The corrupted zone is ahead...	
302040607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This should buy some time for the Gray Raven, right?	
302040701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Unable to open?! What does that mean! I managed to crack into it...	
302040702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That's because your crack is one-way only. You can only open all security doors if you execute the crack.	
302040703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But in that case, the guards can also get in and surround us.	
302040704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, apart from an "open door" function, we need a "close door" one as well. The two actions must be done at the same time.	
302040705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Easy-peasy! I can connect the two cracking devices to the same "repeater". Problem solved.	
302040706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, repeating is the easy part. The difficult part is that the second cracking device has to connect the "closing" system.	
302040707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As door opening and door closing are two separate systems, we can only crack it one by one.	
302040708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Lucia and the others are defending against the guards outside. We have to crack the door closing system quickly.	
302040709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You need to be quick. As more and more guards are trying to break through the exterior wall, they will break through our defense soon...	
302040710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Right... But why did the crack fail? Definitely nothing to do with my devices.	
302040711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes, Nithart crashed the system on purpose while we were cracking. That's why it failed.	
302040712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll connect the door closing system to my virtual console. If she does that again, she'll be redirected to it.	
302040713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Operating the final crack... Security doors opened...	
302040714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Everyone, through the security door! Quick!	
302040715	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee...	
302040716	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay. Operating the final crack... Security doors closed...	
302040801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch your front and back, the guards are tightening the encirclement...	
302040802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We have to destroy them all to prevent them from attacking the rescue aircraft.	
302040803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The royal guards are very difficult to handle. If we don't want to be attacked from both sides, we'd better concentrate our firepower on one side first.	
302040804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Commandant, quick! Which side! I'm gonna blow them all to smithereens!	
302040901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Nithart... she turned off the external sensorium of her frame.	
302040902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She and the royal guards have already fused into one. Even if we concentrate our firepower on her, we'll still be unable to interrupt the guards' attack.	
302040903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Just blow 'em all up!	
302040904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Can we attack now? Nanami wants to fight!	
302040905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The Golden Vortex will turn into an inferno soon. We'd better go now. We can't let Nithart be on our way...	
302040906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's make a clean break with Nithart.

303152106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	It seems that you have completely understood it.	
303152107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Now, let's get started.	
303152108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Wait for it to move near the white line on the left.	
303152109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And tap the button on the left to clear it.	
303152110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Light beams will come out both from the left and the right.

303152113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Now let's give it a go.	
303152114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	When the light beams on both sides are identical, they will be in <color=#FFCC00>yellow</color>.	
303152115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And you need to tap both buttons at the same time to clear them.	
303152116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	Give it a try.	
303152117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	And then, a new note will show up.	
303152118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	It is comprised of two light beams front and back and an arrow in between.	
303152119	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	You need to tap the button when the first light beam reaches the white line and keep pressing it	
303152120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Haicma	1	until the second light beam reaches the white line.

313011201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Almost there.

313011402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	It was Miss Ayla's request to test the New Year Coating's combat adaptability...	
313011403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	But this is still too...	
313011404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	No, I must stop thinking. Liv, finish your mission first!	
313011405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Miss Ayla is so good... She is not hindered by the outfit at all.	
313011406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	I wish I can wear this and go to a shrine with everyone of Gray Raven...	
313011501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Alright, one final mission left.	
313011502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Let's begin!	
313011503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Oops, it's almost 12am!

313011507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Thank you, God.	
313011508	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Liv	1	Alright, time to go back. Commandant and others are waiting for me.	
313020201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go, Commandant.	
313020202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, that Corrupted that has been acting as a leader is about to run off. Let's go after it.

313020205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Save your breath. Commandant and I won't spare any single one of Corrupted.	
313020206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Still late... Tch!	
313020207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Something has exposed my location for sure.	
313020208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Never mind, I was just talking to myself.	
313020301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I didn't know consciousness connection would be that different from usual.	
313020302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'm like Commandant's little doll. Please take good care of us, will you?	
313020303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Wait... In this sense...	
313020304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems that the connection between Commandant and here is over. We'll search this area shortly.	
313020305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll give it my all, Commandant!	
313020401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Speaking of which, Commandant, have you noticed that some of our voice messages weren't censored?	
313020402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Perhaps it can be used to recognize our true identities.	
313020403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Will recognizing who we are... really help us get through this situation?	
313020404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Commandant, it seems you have to change your connection target.	
313020405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Will the next guy find Commandant?	
313020406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Not sure, but we've already narrowed down the range of searching area. We should be able to calculate Commandant's location very soon.	
313020407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'll see you at that place, Commandant.	
313020501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Consciousness connection...	
313020502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	In a nutshell, Commandant exists within my body in addition to ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†, right?	
313020503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Let us show you the power of the trio, Corrupted!	
313020504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Ah, It's the message from ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†. I'll go to the rendezvous point too.	
313020505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Commandant, wait for me!	
313020801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	I'll repeat the rules, just for you.	
313020802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Those standing before you are the Constructs closest to you.	
313020803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	The reason they become like this is because of your cognitive bias.	
313020804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Next, I'll ask questions like which one is the real Liv and which one is the real Kamui.	
313020805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	What you need to do is to point out their true identities.	
313020806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Of course, it'd be great if you're right. But if you're wrong‚Äî	
313020807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Nozzle comes close to initiating a self-destruct sequence. This will damage you and the Constructs.	
313020808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Humph, are you really be able to recognize each of them? I look forward to your performance.	
313020811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	What? This is...!	
313020851	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Wrong. That's a pity. Your Constructs will get hurt if you don't pay more attention.	
313020852	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	First Question. Which one is Kamui?	
313020853	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct, though it's merely a simple one.	
313020854	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Second question. Which one is Liv?	
313020855	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct. As expected, that humility has made it too obvious.	
313020856	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Third question. Which one is Bianca?	
313020857	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How does it feel like to be mistaken for Watanabe, your sworn enemy?	
313020858	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	‚Äî!	
313020859	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No need to overreact. I've been watching it from the very beginning.	
313020860	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fourth question. Which one is Ayla?	
313020861	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No fun. When she said association, the answer nearly came to the surface.	
313020862	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fifth question. Which one is Chrome?	
313020863	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That said, Chrome appearing in this place really surprised me. I thought he was preparing for the next special mission.	
313020864	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Sixth Question. Which one is Lee?	
313020865	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Well, as you've excluded all deceptive answers, it's no surprise that you chose the correct one.	
313020866	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you give scythes a shot? You seem to be a great scythe wielder.	
313020867	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	After all, nothing is hard for you... Hah.	
313020868	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Seventh question. Which one is Karenina... To be honest, I don't want to go on like this either. The rest are all super simple ones.	
313020869	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Uh... Alright alright. Correct. All words coming from this mouth would be censored by the connection system.	
313020870	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	The last question. Which one is Lucia? Press the confirm button <color=#ff6633>now</color> to finish this game.	
313020871	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you act? Lucia stood right there. You didn't fall asleep, did you?	
313020872	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...What!?	
313020873	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That's not Lucia... Hahahaha, so you really can recognize her. Hahaha!	
313020874	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Perfect. You're right...	
313020875	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	‚Äî!!	
313020876	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...For hell's sake. I knew it. The bond between commandant and Construct is but a joke.	
313020877	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How can you not recognize the Construct staying by your side all the time?	
313020878	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No way. How can you pick this one? You're not a moron, aren't you?	
313020879	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fine...	
313020880	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Lu... Musashi, catch that Nozzle!	
313020881	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	???	1	Here, Commandant!	
313030101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Hey, Akdilek girl, what are you doing...?	
313030102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sorry, my hand slipped.	
313030103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Causing troubles instead of killing me, huh... Lucky that you're a Support type.	
313030104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sophia doesn't understand what you are talking about.	
313030105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Whatever... Keep pretending.	
313030106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But you can't keep hiding. We have big guys coming.	
313030107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	As expected, they are Attacker Constructs. Very old models though.	
313030108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	What exactly are you planning?	
313030301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Can I use these leaves?	
313030302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Yeah, they still have a bitter taste, but I guess we don't have a better option.	
313030303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We need more though. These aren't enough.	
313030304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Corrupted spotted. Let's get rid of them first.	
313030351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I never knew there were plants in the desert.	3
313030352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	I feel sorry for these plants...	3
313030353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I bet these leaves have never thought they would get picked in a desert.	3
313030354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I wonder what kind of zongzi Lucia would like?	3
313030355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I think red bean will be a great addition to the zongzi.	3
313030356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The leaves are a bit annoying, but zongzi contain meat and rice, making them a great food.	3
313030501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	This Corrupted... I knew it...	
313030502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Focus on the Corrupted around you. You could easily die if you get distracted.	
313030503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Yes! Got it.	
313040301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Truth or dare!	
313040302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Answer the other person's question within the time limit!	
313040303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	If you can't answer, or refuse to... You'll have to perform a daring forfeit!	
313040304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	So this is like a mind training, where Liv must answer Commandant's questions. I will do my best!	
313040305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: What's your fondest wish?	
313040306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	To defeat Punishing Virus and take back the Earth.	
313040307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: What will you do if your most important person argues with you?	
313040308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Could it be... I have done something wrong? I'll try to correct my mistake, and apologize to Com‚Äîto that person, I mean.	
313040309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Question: Which type of boyfriend do you prefer: cat or dog?	
313040310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Huh...? What do you mean by cat and dog...?	
313040311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	An animal as boyfriend...?	
313040312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	No way.	
313040313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Too bad! You failed to answer within the time limit! You must face a forfeit!	
313040314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	The ammo of my Levi-Gun has all become water... Is it because we are in a game?	
313040315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	It's a game from the Golden Age. The questions are probably based on the pop culture of that era.	
313040316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	I see. I need a better understanding of the Golden Age culture to answer these questions.

313070303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Mm-hmm. The machines will be erratically moving around within a confined area. You need to remember how many of them there are and what they look like.	
313070304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	South General	1	Say, we have three Repairers, a Ground Monitor, and an Aerial Monitor within the confined area.

313070405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	West General	1	Just so we're clear... I'm not like those two you met earlier. My traps are no child's play. Hehe.	
313070406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	What...?	
313070407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Just avoid the traps, and we'll be fine. I trust Commandant's judgment and will follow accordingly.

313070501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Commandant... Something's wrong. My body is...	
313070502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	North General	1	That's because I rigged this place. Anyway, just remember: only one "tactic" per person.	
313070503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In other words, Commandant, each one of us can only use one type of Signal Orbs.

313070506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If it was just you versus me, you might yet stand a chance. But I'm not fighting alone.

313090306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	I need two parts to repair it. A portable battery and a receiver.	
313090307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	These Terrapods were supposed to be practice partners for new soldiers...

313094302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WulunNormal01.png	Ballwheel	1	Lion dance? Do you mean that dancing and hopping lion performance?	
313094303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Too bad you can't throw your wheels out while jumping.

313094322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Is this the final step?	
313094323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	I heard that you were really "nice" to my workers. I will be greatly disappointed if you can't even defeat me.

313094333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	No. My guys all spoke highly of you.	
313094334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	Their opinions matter a lot to me. That alone would make me join your lion dance team.	
313094335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Really? Hooray!	
313094341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	I see you have gathered everyone... You know what the final step is, don't you?

313094343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	I see you have persuaded all my workers to join. You've got some decent capabilities.

313094345	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Understood. Sophia's all up for a fight.	
313094351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	Good work, young blood.	
313094352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	What about the lion dance?	
313094353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Hanged Man Foreman	1	I'm in, of course!	
313094354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Alright. Welcome to the team.	
313094361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Hoho, now that we have the team ready.	
313094362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	I'm sure we will be the best performance in the comms.	
313094363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	But the show you planned would take at least 40 minutes... I think we only have 5 minutes each.	
313094364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Changyu	1	Oops... You should have told me earlier, Sophia.	
313110301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I knew there would be some remnant Corrupted around here...

313110401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Destroy all the invading Corrupted... Let none survive!	
313110402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The Corrupted are separated by complicated pathways.	
313110403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Let's take them down one by one!

313110707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	I'm supposed to be the one asking...	
313110751	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Don't bully Nanami's friends!	3
313110901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You said "collecting"... What do you plan to do to it?!	
313110902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	We aren't going to do anything to "it," Karey deary! We just need to collect what it drops!	
313110903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	...So we still need to aim our shots, don't we?	
313110904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hmm, I think that's enough. I feel very sad for it if we keep firing.	
313110905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	It's already sad enough.	
313110906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Alright, we have all the baits. Now it's time for the real show!	
313111101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Bad Corrupted!	
313111102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	You are the reason why "Xi" is so scared!	
313111103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hmph! Nanami is going to bash all of you!	
313111104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Looking at it now, I think we did a great job.	
313111105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	That's why we must not let our effort get wasted...	
313111106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	There are more Corrupted over there! Let's goooo!	
313120301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Huh? Where's that strange rabbit?	
313120302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Nanami can see a few people near the place it disappeared. Let Nanami ask them!	
313120303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	Hello? What did you say? Nanami doesn't understand at all...

313120312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hat-wearing Program	1	But you need to answer a question first. "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"	
313120313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Nanami	1	What kind of question is that? Nanami has no idea... What would the answer be?

110353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The normal route leads people to this fake hall...	
110354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To enter the real guest hall, we must take a special route.	
110355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I locked up all those Corrupted that the Estate could not destroy inside this room.	
110356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	If those people are going to use you, I would rather you get consumed by the Corrupted...	
110357	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Did he purposely separate us?	
110358	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a waste of effort. I've already found you.	
110359	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That voice sounds so familiar...	
110360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey, butler. Did something happen over there?	
110361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He's not answering. Let's find a way out first.	
110362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will stop you right here.

110367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It's all for Miss Luna.	
110368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will... never yield!	
110369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Ugh... Aaargh!	
110370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.

110376	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Corrupted incoming... Emma... lost... Must... protect... Emma...

110405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I need to scan Zack's memory shell before attempting to repair him.	
110406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The structure of the memory shell is simple, but for some reason, it isn't deeply infected.	
110407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's investigate together.	
110408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The tag of the important record is "Operation Grand Retreat".	
110409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing Virus has infested these data zones. The virus illusions are impacting our data query.	
110410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I've made some progress. All related data found. Loading now.	
110411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I just need to repair one more section to start reading Zack's memories.

110416	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Large-scale data corruption here. Leave it to me.	
110417	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, Corrupted controlled by the Punishing Virus already had military production capabilities.	
110418	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Even with the comprehensive defense of this Estate Museum, it could not hold against the overwhelming number of Corrupted.	
110419	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That was the situation they had to face.	
110420	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Zack... help... Emma and Copperfield... retreat...	
110421	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We've reached the deepest part of the data. The record shows Zack was already being infected at that time.	
110422	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But somehow the infection was restricted and controlled at a certain level.	
110423	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's clear the virus illusions here and read the final record.	
110424	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Zack... We are the only ones left here.	
110425	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will take you to the Static Lock. I hope Mr. Copperfield's research will work.	
110426	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Before that, I just need to calm you down... I never thought we would end up like this.

110605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I haven't fought for a long time. Looks like... this will be my last fight.	
110606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Gargh. This power still impacts my mind... In the end, it still tests my faith...	
110607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk. I thought that God bloke abandoned me long ago...	
110608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are way too many Corrupted. Commandant, we should retreat now!	
110609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I should continue... with my final cleansing...	
110610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Simulation in progress. Commandant, please watch closely!	
110611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Even in this time, her frame capabilities are as good as ours in battle.	
110612	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But we have no information at all... I wonder how many secrets did the Church have in the past?	
110613	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All those Corrupted came from the machine factory's direction.	
110614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If the source remains, their numbers would only keep growing... Exactly like what happened to us.	
110615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Sister's destination... seems to be right there.	
110616	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Phew, just like those little brats... You always look down on adults.	
110617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Do you know how difficult it is to be an adult...? Get out of my way!

110620	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Punishing Virus' impact must have peaked around this point.	
110621	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These are... the large firefighting robots we met before...	
110622	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yet, Punishing Virus modified them into arsonists. How ironic.	
110623	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Data interfered by virus illusions...	
110624	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. I'm activating emergency mode.	
110625	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay. We've seen it many times. We know what to do.	
110626	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Virus interference removed. Re-syncing now.	
110627	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, the virus infection is rooted deeply here... It needs a deep cleaning. I'll need help.	
110628	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	She managed to... hold off so many Corrupted here...	
110629	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As if she had an endless reserve of energy... Was it because of the Punishing Virus, or her own obsession?	
110630	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, it's a new combat objective!	
110631	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of broken memory probably came from when Sister was hunted by Nozzle.	
110632	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to manually repair the noise while tracing the memory.	
110633	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recording complete. So this is when Sister met Nozzle.	
110634	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Next section... Okay, done.	
110635	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	After ascension, even Nozzle could use tactics against its enemy.	
110636	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The final section is also recorded.	
110637	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There were just too many Corrupted. Even Sister had no choice but to run.	
110638	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	This is the factory's core...	
110639	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Why would humans design such a fragile structure... Once it's destroyed, everything will be lost. How unreliable.	
110640	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data shows that Sister had already reached her infection limit.	
110641	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But she hadn't completed her objective yet...	
110642	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's finish this journey with her.	
110643	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All missions in the current stage have been completed. Go to the memory breakpoint to start the next stage.	3
110644	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of memory is already close to the end.	
110645	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...This should be Sister's final struggle.	
110646	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's go get her final memory.	
110647	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110648	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110649	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
117010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data videos show that Rohacchi found some spark falling into the ruins.	
117010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And it became very interested in it.	
117010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It then traced all the way toward the spark's landing point.	
117010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It seemed to have also activated some mechanism within the ruins...	
117010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To further analyze the videos in this memory data...	
117010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I will recreate the situation by video.	
117010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory is completely restored. Rohacchi opened this switch to move to a higher level.	3
117010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The sealed road opened again.	3
117010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On its journey, Rohacchi ran into the source of the spark and noises... and got attacked by "Roseblade".	
117010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As expected, all the suddenly appeared Constructs were related to Ascendants. They were also after "Tenebrion".	
117010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I suggest we carefully study the combat data against "Roseblade". It will benefit our subsequent operations.	
117010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Rohacchi seemed to have met similar-looking machines.	
117010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It thought they were its own kind and went up to them.	
117010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Only to be met with sudden assault.	
117010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Subsequent memory data has been deciphered. Transforming to digital video now.	
117010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	In the memory, IX-68 squatted next to one of its "kin," slowly patting its body...	
117010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Here, Rohacchi met Nanami...	
117010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And suddenly attacked...!?	
117010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Perhaps we could find more information about Nanami from this memory.	
117010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The battle didn't last long, and Nanami seemed to have moved together with Rohacchi for some time.	
117010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the memory, Rohacchi and Nanami defeated many Corrupted and returned to the upper level of the ruins.	
117010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Looks like the "mural" they were talking about must be nearby.	
117010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll continue with my analysis, Commandant. Please look out for any info related to the "mural" that caused them to awaken.	
117010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to Rohacchi's memory, this should be where they first saw the mural.	
117010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But when it took Nanami there, they found nothing.	
117010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Apart from those machines wandering nearby.	
117010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe the ruins collapsed because of us, so the murals also fell to another location.	
117010605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No matter what, this piece of memory is worth studying again.	
118010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found well-preserved facilities underneath the ruins.	
118010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I tried my best to stay awake.	
118010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I knew I didn't have much time left.	
118010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So I had to break away from the Corrupted ASAP.	
118010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	One after another. Aren't you tired at all??	
118010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why don't you just come all together? At least it can save some time.	
118010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I must keep moving. No one can stop me.	
118010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At the bottom of the ruins, I found a long and narrow corridor. Unlike the upper levels, the facilities there were kept very well.	
118010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I was exhausted from non-stop fighting.	
118010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Those Corrupted seemed to have noticed this too, and launched an assault together.	
118010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Tsk, the number just keeps growing...	
118010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Looks like you need my help.	
118010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I know what you're planning. I'm not done yet!	
118010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Hah, you bluff. I know full well about your body.	
118010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...I will never let the virus infect me.	
118010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You, stop right there!	
118010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I was shocked to hear such a loud voice. Never thought she would catch up so quickly.	
118010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	And thanks to her, all the wandering Corrupted came up to us. The only thought I had was to never let them get me.	
118010601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	After getting rid of all the annoying Corrupted, Camu launched his final attack too.	
118010602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	He was far more powerful than me. I knew about that. All too well.	
118010603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I had my reasons to fight too...	
118010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Of course I would not fall so easily! Because I must be myself!	
999401501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Commandant... You are finally here...	
999401502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Take me along, and cleanse this planet!	
999401503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Am I Kamui or not? That doesn't matter.	
999401504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadMoney04.png	Archer	1	Your arrow is my arrow!

311010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	If you don't have anything important, I'll hang up. I'm very busy.	
311010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Miss Luna sent me to ask... Well, it's not really about "us"...	
311010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I mean, you are crossing the Bering Strait now.	
311010110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Oh really.	
311010111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't you know? We noticed that your coordinates were moving through the Pacific Ocean over the last week...	
311010112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	So what's going on with you?	
311010113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	I'm on the back of a Narwhal.	
311010114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Um, what...?	
311010115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	I've already controlled its diving module. Maybe three more days...	
311010116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Three days then what?	
311010117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	It will be tamed and become my pet.

311010120	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Yes.	
311010121	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You really are into weird things like this, aren't you...	
311010122	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	It probably has a consciousness that is highly identical to a human's. I find it very interesting.	
311010123	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	The fact that it was attacked by the Corrupted proves this.	
311010124	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	And...	
311010125	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes?	
311010126	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	The view was great there.

311010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Defense terminal stopped running, causing the loss of many defense commands...	
311010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Without commands, they can't do anything.	
311010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So the defense mechanism's stopped working. Aren't the humans here going to do something about it?	
311010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we've done it! All defense machines are back in order.	
311010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Remember, the defense machines are armed with powerful weapons, but they have poor armor.

311010704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Do you even understand what you have done...?	
311010705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	You are my enemy, and I'm going to defeat you. This will never change!	
311010706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	...You never learn.	
311010707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	I made her an Ascendant in order to save her.	
311010708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	But because of what you did...	
311010709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	She will become a mindless puppet controlled by the Punishing Virus instead.	
311010710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Ugh...!	
311010711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	But so what...? Both the Corrupted and the so-called Ascendants are the enemy of humans.	
311010712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Is that so... Whatever.	
311010713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Just stay there and watch. This is the difference between us.	
311010714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Why am I... drawn to her...	
311010801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Hmph. Even as a puppet...	
311010802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	You still know who's the strong one...	
311010803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Let's end it then.	
309010101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It's been a while since I last came here.	
309010102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is this place, Diana...?	
309010103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	During the early outbreak of the Punishing Virus, Murmansk had enjoyed a period of prosperity thanks to its geographical advantages.	
309010104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It absorbed many inland cities and formed a commonwealth. This place was part of the northeast commonwealth.	
309010105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	And one of the birthplaces of Forest Guard.	
309010106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's no time for nostalgia... We are followed.	
309010107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Smells like a prey...	
309010108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forest Guards, continue tracing forward. Stay close to the target...	
309010109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gray Raven will bring up the rear and deal with the enemies in the shadows!	
309010201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The target is not far ahead, but why didn't you ask the Forest Guard to follow up?	
309010202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	You said Evan was on his feet. There's no way he could lose the Corrupted.	
309010203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	But we didn't see him when we locked on to the target...	
309010204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Something's not right.	
309010205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Our target is running away!	
309010206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to failure. Go! Stop it!	
309010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Evan can't just disappear!	
309010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	There must be other clues nearby. Forest Guards! Spread out!	
309010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Search everywhere! Everywhere!	
309010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Someone found a 5cm long, shattered titanium plate...	
309010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please let me take a look!	
309010306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...Yes! There's human sebum and hair on the edges.	
309010307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	That's our first clue! We are on the right track!	
309010308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looking for clues help, but the longer we stay here, the easier we may become the target instead...	
309010309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, are you talking about the wandering Corrupted in the forest?	
309010310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Not just the forest. They could also be among the snowy rocks, even river beds.	
309010311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant! Please stay alerted!	
309010312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm about to process the human pheromones found on these parts...	
309010313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Diana, please give me Evan's weapon. I need to collect his pheromones.	
309010314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The two samples matched perfectly! Evan was here! Now I can make a pheromone detector.	
309010315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Is that...?	
309010316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as Evan is still breathing, we can detect the pheromone he produces.	
309010317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Found him!!	
309010318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	He's trapped on the shell of the Corrupted. Why...? Are they using him to protect themselves?	
309010319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Adjust your equipment immediately! Only melee weapons are allowed. We must not hurt humans!	
309010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I can't cut through these metal bones without hurting the rescue target.	
309010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our only option is to make a strategic relocation. Take it back to the Forest Guard stronghold first, then we can think of another way.	
309010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee... How's his health doing?	
309010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't worry, he's not infected. Just a little hypothermia.	
309010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Strong Punishing reaction detected nearby! Everyone, watch out!	
309010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Corrupted are still killing.	
309010407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Diana, please join us and form a line of defense together.	
309010408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We must not let Corrupted hurt humans.	
309010501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Forest Guard acknowledges Liv's strategic vision.	
309010502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	My sisters and I will do all we can to assist Gray Raven's rescue plan.	
309010503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Calculations complete. The enemy's weak points are its supporting legs.	
309010504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Sisters! Focus fire on the supporting legs!	
309010505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. Mr. Lee didn't include Evan in his calculation...	
309010506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Some of those legs are very close to Evan's location.	
309010507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please, everyone, don't hurt Evan.	
10099001	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That cross-shaped terminal is causing EM polarization on the other devices.	4
10099002	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The affected devices are nigh-immune to most of our attacks.	4
10099003	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Attack the cross-shaped terminal continuously to remove this status from them.	6
10099004	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The light beams radiating from the Heteromer Terminal will repair the Heteromer devices.	5
10099005	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But be careful, these beams contain viruses that will cause stress to our sensory systems if we get hit directly.	6
10099006	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Commandant of Gray Raven, these oddly shaped terminals have the ability to split apart.	5
10099007	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The polar electric current circulating between them can paralyze a Construct's sensory and reduce its mobility.	5
10099008	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But consecutive attacks can reverse their polarity.	4
10099009	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this option if they appear in this form.	4
10090101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the map, we've managed to land at the designated location‚Äî	
10090102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The data analysis cabin on the space station.	
10090103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But... nothing's left of our aircraft...	
10090104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If we can destroy the space station's defense system, then we should be able to retreat when the main forces arrive.	
10090105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	These terminals give me the creeps...	
10090106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is this what the report was talking about? The strange corruption phenomenon localized only in this space station?	
10090107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Be careful, Lee.	
10090108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is...!	
10090109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We managed to unlock a higher clearance level...	
10090110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait, that cross just now is guarding the exit now...	
10090111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to my preliminary scanning results, this type of enemy is not made of any known conventional machinery...	
10090112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It is... composed entirely of the Punishing Virus...	
10090113	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This space station really IS hiding some important secrets...	
10090114	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like we can't just simply blow this place up.	
10090115	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guys, I've turned off the space station's sensor systems.	
10090116	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090117	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This should help relieve some pressure for Babylonia.	
10090118	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, our first step to victory.	
10090201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We have arrived at the second target location.	
10090202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the analysis, this should be the weapons control backend...	
10090203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...after being corrupted and modified by the virus.	
10090204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A lot of inactive Heteromers in here...	
10090205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If they all turn hostile like what happened just now...	
10090206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Do you see that cross-shaped enemy in the middle?	
10090207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're unsure how it manages to...	
10090208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...But it seems like this type of enemy can create enemies, and not to mention that it‚Äî	
10090209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Holds the key to solving our problems, I know...	
10090210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those black pillars... decompose... and reconstruct...	
10090211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Every bit of Hetero-matter of the Punishing Virus in this space station could become our enemy...	
10090212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our attacks can deactivate them, at least temporarily.	
10090213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as it works, right?	
10090214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, let's deal with them like this for now.	
10090215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Finally...	
10090216	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah... Some Hetero-matter have regenerated and are moving again!	
10090217	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch, we're not really in a position to play attrition warfare here...	
10090218	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, access the control system directly. Lee‚Äî	
10090219	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Got it.	
10090220	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Done!	
10090221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All close-range defense systems for interception purposes are offline!	
10090222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The subsequent forces have begun issuing boarding signals.	
10090224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We won't have to fight on our own anymore.	
10090301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But, you do look like you're in some sort of trouble.	
10090302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's skip the small talk.	
10090303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this my little present.	
10090304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies just now displayed a completely different mode of attack.	
10090305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But Watanabe's already figured out how to deal with them...	
10090306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Such strength...	
10090307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He feels like a different person.	
10090308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	So, is everything fine?	
10090309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
10090310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Oh, it's all thanks to you, Mr. Watanabe.	
10090311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Hah, spunky as ever.	
10090401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...This place looks different from the others.	
10090402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The door is encrypted. Your specialty, Lee.	
10090403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Analyzing...)	
10090404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I... see...	
10090405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's four corrupted terminals in the four corners of this compartment.	
10090406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Varied combinations can be produced by activating them...	
10090407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Let's try different combinations.	
10090408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door's cracked, but the Heteromers have entered defense mode...	
10090409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well, progress. At least.	
10090410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's finish off the remaining enemies.	
10090411	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Levels, huh? The mysterious blocks on the terminal might be the key.	3
10090412	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It appears that interacting with the terminal can change the shape of the block...	3
10090413	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Looks like we have to choose a shape...	3
10090414	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Maybe something will happen if we leave a certain number of blocks in the corresponding shapes.	3
10090501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Lucia... She's all pumped up all of a sudden...	
10090502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I see. It's a challenge, isn't it? Hah...	
10090503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	All right, I'll accept it‚ÄîLet's see who can sweep the enemies faster.	
10090504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	How's that? Still got it in me, eh?	
10090505	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Impressive.	
10090506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's work together to protect Liv from the last wave of attacks.

10090508	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Is this what I'm looking for...?	
10090509	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What did you say, Watanabe?	
10090510	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nothing.	
10090601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	You... did not comply with... the regulations...	
10090602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Now... Children... Please kindly follow Korolev to the confinement cabin...	
10090603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Accept your punishment...	
10090604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	If any resistance occurs... Korolev will follow the rules... to adopt the minimum enforcement measures...	
10090605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, that... is...?	
10090606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not composed of Hetero-matter. It's a real Corrupted... I'm afraid...	
10090607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's that Kamui incarnate that's been broadcasting the whole time?	
10090608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But, in such a high viral density environment... Can a machine truly maintain its original mind?	
10090609	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It feels like... it's being held in captivity alone in here... What could be the reason for that...?	
10090610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We might never find the answers... All I know now is that we only have one option...	
10090611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Confinement...	
10090701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Gravity is starting to act up around here...	
10090702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The core of the space station... The gravity room. We finally made it.	
10090703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It's the gravity experiment here that gave birth to Hetero-matter‚Äî	
10090704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Who would have thought‚ÄîHumans aren't just suffering from the Punishing Virus, they even gave it new life...	
10090705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watanabe... Thank you for fighting with us all this way...	
10090706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Don't worry, I won't leave until the threat of this space station is resolved.	
10090707	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I know those enemies were just warm-up for you.	
10090708	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Now, let's show them what we can do.	
10090709	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those crosses... again...	
10090710	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's like their presence is conveying a certain message...	
10090711	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we can't go any further...	
10090712	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is an artificially designed area. Now that we've dispatched the enemies‚Äî	
10090713	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The mechanism should be returning to normal.	
10090714	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Try to get closer to the edge.	
10090715	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What a stunning design...	
10090716	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This can only be achieved by precise gravity manipulation...	
10090717	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	If I recall, there's gravity generators inside Babylonia as well, no?	
10090718	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yes... But I never thought I would come so close to its prototype...	
10090719	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've just tested its integrity. It should be good to go‚Äî	
10090720	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's advance!	
10090721	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is...	
10090722	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Some kind of mechanism again... Guess we can't skip past it.	
10090723	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Ah, it's a device used to lock those rings.	
10090724	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like it's used to stabilize the rings and gravity core.	
10090725	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those rings should function in a similar way. Let's go.	
10090726	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yeah...	
10090801	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'm not sure what would happen if you mess up...	
10090802	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	But please follow my instructions.	
10090803	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The first message is‚Äî	
10090804	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From two to one.	
10090805	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Do you have any ideas?	
10090806	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems to be related to these light beams...	
10090807	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll try to brute-force it, but it's going to take some time.	
10090808	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	And it might trigger high alert. Anyway, let's get through this together, Commandant.	
10090809	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It worked.	
10090810	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Miss Ayla, please provide the next instruction!	
10090811	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, the next message is‚Äî	
10090812	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From abstract to concrete.	
10090813	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Abstract and concrete... We've encountered enemies like that before.	
10090814	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Which means... "Starting from the abstract"?	
10090815	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's do it then!	
10090816	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We can move on now!	
10090817	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The path is blocked off again.	
10090818	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	As you can see... There's three movable mechanisms...	
10090819	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We do!	
10090820	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	According to the record, the tip here is‚Äî	
10090821	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The beginning is the end.	
10090822	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm, I think I kind of get it...	
10090823	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Same as before, I'll try to crack it forcibly.	
10090824	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As expected, you solved the puzzle first, Commandant.	
10090825	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, here we're again...	
10090826	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	It should be the last mechanism for this ring.	
10090827	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Please tell us the last tip.	
10090828	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, listen carefully‚Äî	
10090829	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Disarray is unity.	
10090830	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is even more cryptic...	
10090831	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But experience tells us that we have to create a certain pattern using these light beams.	
10090832	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Although I'm not quite certain about it, I think we might want to create as many divisions and chaos as we can with the beams.	
10090833	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Backend hacking is also in progress.	
10090834	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I think... We got it?	
10090835	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yep, well done!	
10090836	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
10090837	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The control mechanism for the next ring has appeared.	
10090838	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's continue.	
10090839	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Only a few rings left.	
10090840	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yeah, we'd better hurry. Other troops should be on their way now.	
10090841	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No matter what enemy awaits...	
10090842	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This time, we have countless teammates on our side.	
10090843	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hmm... maybe it's implying that we have to create a certain pattern.	3
10090844	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Two into... Maybe it's something about the number of light beams.	3
10090845	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	One might mean a circle, but what does it have to do with the tip?	3
10090846	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Two paths, a single line. I feel like we're nearing the answer.	3
10090847	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Is it meant to be taken literally...?	3
10090848	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If the lines that are crossed becomes connected instead... I guess?	3
10090849	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	A ring structure...? Could it be a clue to solving this puzzle?	3
10090850	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Having the beams circulate should match the tip...	3
10090851	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Connecting it in another way might be worth a try...	3
10090852	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Maybe we should make the straight lines at the beginning into something else?	3
10090853	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Light beams... Prism... Three points... Perhaps we can indeed change something...	3
10090854	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Make the single... No, the two merged light beams split. Perhaps... Maybe...	3
10090855	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I will hack into it from the backend now.	3
10090901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies here look different...	
10090902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They didn't decomposed upon being defeated. Instead‚Äî	
10090903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They entered into a state similar to hibernation... Their energy flow is stable inside their remains...	
10090904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No more paths forming ahead. Might be because of these enemies.	
10090905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I don't know what you make of it, but we'd better act with caution.	
10090906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After all, this is a new variant from the ones we've been dealing with.	
10090907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait... Are they... gathering around us?	
10090908	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They aren't displaying aggression somehow...	
10090909	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nonsense.	
10090910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Unless...	
10090911	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What's on your mind, Watanabe?	
10090912	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
10090913	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll speak for him‚ÄîUnless the virus chooses to.	
10090914	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The virus chooses to? You mean the Punishing Virus is able to make a choice?	
10090915	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's a sign of intelligence, but...	
10090916	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I don't know... I'm afraid no one knows why, frankly.	
10090917	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well... It's not like we have many options now.	
10090918	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A path is made... The energy inside these enemies are transferred to the mechanism...	
10090919	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And also flowing towards the gravity core.	
10090920	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Sounds just like a recipe for disaster.	
10090921	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That core is the primary target of this operation.	
10090922	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At the very least... We're getting closer to our final target.	
10090923	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No more new enemies, Lucia.	
10090924	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Then, this should be the final mechanism.	
10090925	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After passing through here, we'll be facing the largest Heteromer that is mooching off on the gravity core.	
10090926	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to our defeat at this point.	
10090927	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Gray Raven, prepare for battle!

30150110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, we've arrived at the designated location. Nearby devices show apparent traces of being tampered by Gabriel.	
30150111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All devices are expected to be recovered in five minutes.	
30150112	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After this, Engineering Force can "touch down" on the space station and carry out their duties...

11100204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Okay, then we'll destroy the Corrupted lurking there.	
11100205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia.	
11100206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Got it...	
11100207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	The battle is over.	
11100208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The passage is clear!	
11100209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's clear, Sophia!	
11100210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Understood. I'm coming now.	
11100301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia!	
11100302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
11100303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out for their special attacks.	
11100304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	It's all cleared.	
11100305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Let's meet up with them now. Changyu's there too.	
11100401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's shell is hard to break. Liv, can you identify its weaknesses?	
11100402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm trying!	
11100403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We can't go on like this.	
11100404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Gray Raven is fighting the Core's Heteromers.	
11100405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Fend off the Corrupted. Ensure they won't bring any trouble to us.	
11100406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...I'll take care of the ones behind us.

11100409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	All cleared. Changyu, what's the situation on your end?

11100502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Then save your breath. I have to deal with your wounds first.	
11100503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...Roger that.	
11100504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	This way leads back to the carriage.

11100602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia...	
11100603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll be careful...	
11100604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's enough.	
11100605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Half of the Corrupted have been destroyed. This area is safe for now.	
10100101	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! It's...	
10100102	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A hideous appearance indeed.	
10100103	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Can you hear me, Gray Ravens? I've detected that you've successfully landed on the train.	
10100104	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...And we are now facing the target.	
10100105	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, what do you mean?	
10100106	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Hetero-Core has been highly corrupted and mutated when falling to Earth. The target we've been after is right before us.	
10100107	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Permission for engagement, Commandant.	
10100108	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Heterozygote's claws seem super dangerous.	
10100109	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Perhaps we can entice it to attack us, then we have a chance to destroy its claws.	
10100110	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not working. Our attacks hardly deal any damage to it.	
10100111	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch out, it isn't finished yet.	
10100201	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This train is...?	
10100202	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Focus. The enemies aren't finished yet.	
10100203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing concentration continues to surge... It's corrupting the new train!	
10100204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, bring sufficient serum. We'll go after it.	
10100205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Hey, you're not here to make the deal, are you?	
10100206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What are you talking about?	
10100207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	If it stops here, Lord Jamilah's plan will be disrupted. It's time to act, Sophia!	
10100208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	...Understood. Then push it to the front.	
10100209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Who are these...?	
10100210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The sandstorm has disrupted our visual system and the number of Corrupted is increasing. They will hinder our pursuit.	
10100211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, I propose that we adjust the operation, passing through inside the train to intercept our target.	
10100212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Glass cupola...	
10100213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Perhaps we can go inside the train through the cupola.	
10100214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At this rate, the train will enter the area ravaged by sandstorm... We'll be forced to abandon the pursuit.	
10100215	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But if we don't deal with it right now, this train will be the next victim...	
10100301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those mechanoids are... attacking each other?	
10100302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
10100303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...It seems that the uncorrupted mechanoids are defending against the corrupted ones.	
10100304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll help.	
10100305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You're here too, Sophia.	
10100306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	In order to evacuate the people, we have to intercept the Heterozygote formed by core mutation.	
10100307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This way!	
10100308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	That is the aristocrats' carriage. If we enter without permission...	
10100309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Commoners and aristocrats, aren't we humans at the end of the day? Come this way if you want to live!	
10100310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
10100311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	Okay, I got it!	
10100312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're safe now.	
10100313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's great...	
10100314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We'd better leave once we've planned our next step.	
10100315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	(Akdilek Record)	
10100316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	This train is refitted with the Central Purification Filter designs of the City Series of 020, 030, and 050.	
10100317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	But the truth is, the filter is not capable of supporting the whole train.	
10100318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Therefore, after the completion of all works, all carriages will be classified and, superior races will be separated from the inferior ones.	
10100319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Like Babylonia, we will keep hope alive.	
10100401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sophia, enemy signals come from there!	
10100402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	There's a ladder ahead on the train roof.	
10100403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we'd been allowed to do our work earlier, none of this would've happened.

10100405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Move now, Commandant.	
10100406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait, something falling down!	
10100407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	No more obstacles. I have to reach Changyu quickly.	
10100408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go, Commandant!	
10100409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Is it... a letter?	
10100410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	My name... It no longer matters. I thought I could have gotten through this train and completed the mission.	
10100411	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	But in the end, I was still a fool. I was classified as a pariah, a slave.	
10100412	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	If we don't act... The Ascendants will...

10100611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Then, I only have to wait on the second floor.

10122307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What do you mean? Who are you then?	
10122308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Going back will take your precious time. So if you are after the Ascendants‚Äî	
10122309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Answer my questions, and you may pass. Of course, you are also welcome to break through with force.	
10122310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Um... Do you know her?	
10122311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	‚Ä¶‚Ä¶	
10122312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	S-sort of...? (Dry laughter)	
10122313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	So she's controlling the passage here. Alright.	
10122314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Are you ready? Let's begin...	
10122315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	The first question is...	
10122316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Here comes the second question...	
10122317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	And the third question is...	
10122318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Light and shadow are one and the same. Where the light flourishes, the shadow also prospers.	
10122319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	In the courtyard there is an abundance of light, in the shadows the answer hides.	
10122320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Show me the "Lightless Veranda" should you seek the truth.	
10122321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	That is all. Do take your time.	
10122322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	What does "lightless" mean...? It's so bright everywhere.	
10122323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No. There is one place without light.	
10122324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Commandant, please make your decision.	
10122325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Compared with the other verandas...	
10122326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	This one isn't any different...	
10122327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Not quite... Just look up...	
10122328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Oh...! I see...!	
10122329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is what differs this veranda from the others.	
10122330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I see... The light isn't on...	
10122331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Is that what "lightless" meant?	
10122332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Wind flows through the void, traveling to and fro in the courtyard.	
10122333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	But anchored is your answer, untouched it is by ebbs and flows.	
10122334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Should you desire the truth, locate the "Chamber of Windrest".	
10122335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	She said "windrest"... Hmm...	
10122336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Ah, I got it! The wind must stop somewhere!	
10122337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Commandant, we just have to find a place without wind.	
10122338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I can't put it into words, but...	
10122339	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I have a feeling that this is the place.	
10122340	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm... Looking up close, the wind here is a lot weaker.	
10122341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	See, the painting is barely moving.	
10122342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Causes criss-crosses with effect. That which touches this land not, therein your answer lies.	
10122343	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You will find your answer in the "Pavilion of Difference".	
10122344	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	That which exists here not shall lead you to the pavilion.	
10122345	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Did she mention "difference"?	
10122346	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are three shades of different machines. Looks like we need to find the correct answer from them...	
10122347	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	One of them is different from the others. Commandant, it's very obvious, don't you think?	
10122348	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I knew it...	
10122349	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	One of the illusions is different from the rest.	
10122350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Different? What do you mean...	
10122351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This Heteromer unit is only seen in Asslam. It doesn't exist in this city.	
10122352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's the "difference" she was talking about.	
10122353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well. Would you like a compliment?	
10122354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Defeat the "answer" to complete my challenge.	
10122355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well. Not many can spot the difference.	
10122356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Next, you only need to defeat the "answer".	
10122357	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A splendid display. I have underestimated you.	
10122358	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Go. The "answer" is right ahead.	
10122359	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A pity. You did not understand my message.	
10122360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	My my. Are you uncultured, or purely daft?	
10122361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Are you still lost? Yet truth is one and only.	
10122362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	It's a shame. Though your determination does pique my interest.	
10122363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Very well... We shall consider this done.	
10122364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You have passed my first test.	
10122365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	In front of you is the guardian of the courtyard.	
10122366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Defeat it to prove your strength.	
10122367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	A less than satisfactory performance, but, you pass.	
10122368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Make your way through. Qu is at the top of the tower.	
10122369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	How unexpected. Truly amazing. Should we have a chat, good people from Babylonia?	
10122370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Who are you? I don't feel any hostility from you.	
10122371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	I am hostile, though perhaps not as much as the others. I'm a member of the Kowloong Crew, after all.	
10122372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Kowloong Crew... What's your relationship with those on the Nighter...?	
10122373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	They replicated our system. On the Nighter, they have nine members.	
10122374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	But right here in Kowloong, we have nine crews.	
10122375	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	So... Nine special departments in the city?	
10122376	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	You can say that. Plus, not all of us are involved in such reckless warfare.	
10122377	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	So, not everyone's supporting Qu?	
10122378	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	She's only a vessel of the will of the majority. And she knows that.	
10122379	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Anyway, consider this a little nice gesture. I shall waste no more of your time.	
10122380	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	The door is now open. Qu is at the top of the tower. You can go ahead.	
10122381	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	(First Gabriel, and now Gray Raven.)

11120306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Œ±	1	Let's see how long your little toys can keep up.

10115203	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	A few weird mechanoids were carrying something and sneaking around. They ran off the second they saw me!	
10115204	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Then I was intercepted by Musashi IX!	
10115205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Musashi IX...? Why is it here?	
10115206	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	I've never seen this mechanoid. No corruption signal detected... Kamui, what's your status?	
10115207	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Tch, we lost sight of it!	
10115208	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Kamui, send the image data of that strange mechanoid you met to me.	
10115209	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	You got it!	
10115210	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What's that noise... I'll go check!	
10115211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Come back! I need to upload the image data to the system terminal for further analysis...	
10115212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	There you are!	
10115213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Stay there and wait for me. Don't do anything rash.

10130205	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No matter what went through, we'll have to go through this if we want to find it.

10130304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	It's a long story. I have my mission too.

10130306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	There are some Defense Programs patrolling this area... Let's get rid of them before they raise the alarm.	
10130307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Are they trying to protect something?	
10130308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	From their patrol pattern, I don't see anything worth our attention. Maybe we'll find some clues in this area.	
10130309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's search around then.	
10130310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	No luck here. We'll have to...	
10130311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Are you really "Bianca"?

10130506	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...She's even hijacked the security barrier module.	
10130507	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The port to deactivate it is on the other side... We can't do anything from here.

10130514	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...Guess we have to go through them.	
10130515	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	A hidden channel, as I thought.	
10130516	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to my scan, the destination of her bridging connection... is right there.	
10130531	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The billboards look a bit strange... Is that also a result of bridging?	
10130532	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Indeed. I can probably estimate her jump locations and routes using that.

10130538	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't know. He is still marked as "missing in action" in the database.	
10130539	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's a stone monument in front of the parliament. I feel like it carries many stories.

10131502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Affirmative. Take down the Riot model before Hiro comes back, then sweep and clear all Corrupted elements.	
10131503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Five-by-five! Let's go, Murol!

10131512	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Must be the Punishing Virus.	
10131513	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Xun	1	Records indicate that the virus has rewritten and repaired its hosts before.

10131518	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Murol	1	Be careful... facing Riot alone...	
10131519	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I see... All I remembered was the electronic shackle on Riot had somehow disappeared.	
10131520	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I didn't know I was the only one left.	
10131521	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But that's okay. I will take on it by myself, just like what I did last time!

10140301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They said it requires more investigation, but will the Red Tide really be in such places?	
10140302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At any rate, there are only scorched earth and ashes left.	
10140303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	But it is true that high concentrations of Punishing Virus can be detected occasionally.	
10140304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I'll set up the detection device while you go and check the situation below.	
10140305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Let me know if you find anything.	
10140306	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Isn't this the core strike zone of the Longinus Arsenal?	
10140307	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why are there Hetero-Creatures here?!	
10140308	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	It seems that the previous detection was not a false positive.	
10140309	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There are some things hidden nearby.	
10140310	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These Hetero-Creatures are frailer than before.	
10140311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Ah, so you've taken care of them as well...	
10140312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	The same is true for upper floor. Some Hetero-Creatures here and there, but it's easily taken are of.	
10140313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I guess it may be because the Red Tide is declining.	
10140314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	High levels of Punishing Virus can also be detected in the boxes nearby.	
10140315	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Although it may be residue, just to be safe...	
10140316	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's break them all open and check!	
10140317	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Yes, that's right.	
10140318	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanna bet and see who finds more hidden Hetero-Creatures?	
10140319	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Why would I do something like that‚Ä¶	
10140320	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	But I'll come to your aid if you're in trouble.	
10140321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Deal!	
10140322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wait, that sounded from above.	
10140323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is there a new batch Hetero-Creatures?	
10140324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's go check it out!	
10140325	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Ugh, there's more!	
10140326	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	They don't seem to have been lurking here all the time.	
10140327	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Maybe they came from somewhere else?	
10140328	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Not too many enemies left, let's get it over with.	
10140329	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What are these?!	
10140330	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	A new variety.	
10140331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There's not a lot of them. Maybe they got separated or only they survived?	
10140332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This area has been cleared.	
10140333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Well, the Punishing concentration was also detected to be abnormal.	
10140334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	OK, let's call Capt over.	
10140335	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This area has been cleared.	
10140336	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanshi, how's it going over there?	
10140337	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hmm? Are you still dealing with those detection device?	
10140338	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Let's go and check on him!	
10140350	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wanshi! I did it!	
10140351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I see. I'll come over to help.	
10140352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	All the boxes are checked!	
10140353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	There's not too many, you can handle it yourself.	
10140354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I'll continue to install the detection device, so I'll leave the guarding to you.	
10140355	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Mission cleared! Looks like we finished at the same time!	
10140356	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	The Hetero-Creatures haven't given up attacking yet, let's move together.	
10140360	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	I knew there were still some here.	2
10140361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Looks like I was right.	2
10140362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	It's weak, and the Longinus Arsenal did a toll on it.	2
10140363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	These Hetero-Creatures have mastered many skills only seen in animals and insects, such as hiding.	2
10140364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Only residue left here.	2
10140365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	Punishing concentration also has the possibility of false positives.	2
10140366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	No news is good news.	2
10140367	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Wanshi	1	...There's nothing inside.	2
10140368	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	There really are Hetero-Creatures hiding here!	2
10140369	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	What exactly did you do to avoid the Longinus Arsenal?	2
10140370	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found another one!	2
10140371	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Did you just come out and hide here?	2
10140372	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Nothing!	2
10140373	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is it a good news that no Hetero-Creatures have been found?	2
10140374	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	How's everything going over there, Wanshi?	2
10140901	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	I just came up from below.	
10140902	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	The Red Tide over there is not enough to flood the whole underground waterway.	
10140903	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	But you don't need so many Red Tides to kill Constructs.	
10140904	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Get out of here. Even if it isn't flooded, the concentration of Punishing here is high enough to make us Corrupted.	
10140905	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	There are intercepted Hetero-Creatures everywhere.	
10140906	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Fall back while fighting.	
10140907	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	You are... not only injured, but also Corrupted.	
10140908	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	I wish Wanshi were here.	
10140909	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	Damn, there's not even time for repairs.	
10140910	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The concentration of Punishing is still rising.	
10140911	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	You better stay away from me, too, or you'll get worse.	
10140912	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	There you go again.	
10140949	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Looks like a switch connecting the gate.	
10140950	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Camu	1	If the Red Tide wants to pass, this kind of thing can't stop it.	
10140951	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	It is enough to buy us some time.

992008705	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	She gave one treasure to the king and kept the other.	
992008706	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	So it doesn't matter if the king got the fake treasure, because the real treasure has been collected in full at the city gate.

15010604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A Ferris wheel, I think. I saw it in a magazine once.

1017011401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's almost the time to meet up with the other guys.	
1017011402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Wait. The Corrupted nearby are coming over.	
1017011403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Looks like they are controlled by someone.	
1017011404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Is it because the twins are also approaching?	
1017011405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That voice is...!	
1017011406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	Watch out!	
1017011407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Hurry! The entrance is over there!	4
1017011408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Looks like there was a fight...	
1017011409	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The Corrupted and Hetero-Creatures are everywhere.	
1017011410	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	No one can survive this.

1017011412	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Destroy all the Corrupted.	
1017011413	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Proceed to the station platform.	
1017011501	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Gray Raven and Strike Hawk...!	
1017011502	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We are here to help you.	
1017011503	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	Careful! They came out of nowhere and attacked out teammates.	
1017011504	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	But they disappeared when we attempted to strike back.

1017011506	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	These are the monsters we've seen before.	
1017011507	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Hetero-Sapiens! They are trying to get on the train!	
1017011508	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Let me shoot them off with my bullets in advance.	
1017011509	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They are on the train! Keep blocking them! Don't let them get here!	3

1017011601	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Asslam...! We finally made it.	
1017011602	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	I'll leave the Omega II Prototype here. I guess you're gonna need it.	
1017011603	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's right. We have to turn it on to attract them.	
1017011604	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	And to buy some time for the crowd to retreat.	
1017011605	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	We must get the wounded to the train for treatment.	
1017011606	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Alright.	
1017011607	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Prepare to activate the Omega II Prototype here, Lee.	
1017011608	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me.	
1017011610	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Leave it to me. You go deal with the enemies. Don't let them get here.	4
1017011611	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Activated. Now it shouldn't be a problem to kill these Hetero-Creatures.	4
1017011612	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	This one looks different from what we've seen before.	
1017011613	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Enter Matrix. That's the only way to kill it.	
1017011614	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	They were already attracted.	
1017011615	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Chrome	1	The twins are coming over. Prepare for retreat.	
1017011616	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	There are too many enemies... Eliminate them asap!	4
1017011617	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, how is it going? More and more Hetero-Creatures are coming over...	
1017011618	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I need to focus.	3
1018010211	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Snipey! It's a swing! Nanami can swing 2,000 swings per minute!	
1018010212	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	That's awesome...	
1018010213	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Right? Nanami is awesome!	
1018010214	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	No, I meant that swing.	
1018010221	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Mr. Zombie slide. It's inspired by the most popular anime character ever. Have you seen it, Snipey?	
1018010222	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	No. It will only waste my storage space.	
1018010223	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	That's not good. How would you make friends at school if you don't watch the most popular anime?	
1018010224	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I don't go to school, so I don't need any friends there.	
1018010231	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is the octopus slide. And we can also play hide and see around it.	
1018010232	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It's a nice place to hide. You won't be found if you hide in the middle.	
1018010233	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Even if they find you, you can immediately run away in any direction.	
1018010234	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	That's what I'm saying, Snipey!	
1018010241	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The pumpkin baron! My favorite! And it's doll.	
1018010242	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It can shoot its pumpkin head at the bade guy!	
1018010243	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Seems it's just an auto sniper platform just like me except that I shoot bullets.	
1018010244	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	How I wish I could fire laser beams from my head...! NANAMI‚ÄîBEEEEEEEAM!	
1018010251	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is a tramway above ground, plus many skyscrapers.	
1018010252	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This place must have been filled with commuters...	
1018010253	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Meaningless travel will only expose yourself. I'd rather stay put unless it's necessary.	
1018010254	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Then I guess you're a... homebody then.	
1018010261	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This is the way to the recharge station. All these machines are energy-driven.	
1018010262	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	The pursuit of endless energy makes humanity to research the Zero-point Energy.	
1018010263	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The same goes with machines.	
1018010271	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The rest area is ahead of us in this way.	
1018010272	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Are you tired?	
1018010273	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	No. But sometimes it's not only the body that needs rest.	
1018010274	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	But I think I'm more mentally tired than you.	
1018010275	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Then, how about...	
1018010276	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I'm good. Thank you.	
1018010281	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Snipey! It's a bus!	
1018010282	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Why yelling? It's just a common vehicle.	
1018010283	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The bus equals to travel! Travel with friends! Isn't it exciting?	
1018010291	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	The track extends into the distance... What do you say the tram goes to, Snipey?	
1018010292	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Could it be somewhere less cold?	
1018010293	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Impossible. The entire Earth has already fallen into the Ever-Winter.	
1018010294	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	What a shame...	
1018010301	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It's cold! Snipey, I'm gonna catch a cold.	
1018010302	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Machines do not "catch a cold," but the coldness will freeze their buffer fluid and slow down their movement...	
1018010303	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Do not stand still! Eliminate the Corrupted immediately... What are you doing?	
1018010304	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	One, two! One, two! Nanami is warming up, but I don't think I've seen any Corrupted...	
1018010305	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Maybe it is not just us... Perhaps the Corrupted are also frozen in the cold weather.	
1018010311	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Look, Snipey! There's a little bird! It's frozen! Poor bird!	
1018010312	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It does not look like a "little" bird to me...	
1018010313	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Hey, do not approach it. I detected high Punishing Virus concentration. It is a Corrupted!	
1018010314	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Huh?! Then we have to take it down! Snipey, Power, let's go!	
1018010321	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	There is a human ahead! Looks like that person is waving to us!	
1018010322	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It is impossible for humans to survive this cold weather with so few clothes on.	
1018010323	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hello, how are you? Let's go have a look, Snipey!	
1018010324	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I genuinely suspect that there is something wrong with your auditory system. Get it fixed.	
1018010331	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Haha! It's Nanami and Commandant's snowman!	
1018010332	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	The snowman would be buried in the snow in no time in the snowstorm. What you are doing is meaningless.	
1018010333	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	It's a short "moment" for us, but it might be a long "eternity" for the snowman.	
1018010334	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hmm... Something is missing here...	
1018010341	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Ta-da! Perfectly done!	
1018010342	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Nanami will find you, Commandant!	
1018010351	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This human was a mechanoid... and seems to be dead.	
1018010352	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Like I said... It is not "dead." It is "down." And looks like it is impossible to fix it.	
1018010353	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	It is completely frozen. Destroy it if necessary. Let's get its memory unit out and have a look.	
1018010354	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Umm... I'd rather not. Just let it stay here in the snowstorm.	
1018010361	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	This human was a mechanoid... and seems to be dead.	
1018010362	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Perhaps it was a mechanoid who took human kids to the facilities in this amusement park.	
1018010363	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	After all, there are many facilities here. There must have been many kids who came here for them.	
1018010364	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	I will not respond to a groundless speculation like this.	
1018010365	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Pfft. I thought "the most important thing for a soldier is imagination".	
1018010366	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Sniper	1	Maybe I am not a qualified soldier...	
1018010401	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Is this the place?	
1018010402	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Haicma	1	That's the entrance to the aviation lab. It seems it has already been occupied by a group of machines...	
1018010403	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Hello, can I borrow your machines?	
1018010404	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal02.png	Mechanoids	1	Don't... bother us... Don't!	
1018010405	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Ah! Why don't you just listen to me?	
1018010406	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Haicma	1	Let's just take them down!	
1018010407	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	As long as we can find the port, we might be able to contact mecha babushka again...	
1018010408	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	They would have believed me if Snipey were here...	
1018010451	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal02.png	Mechanoids	1	Stop and defeat!	3
1018010452	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Haicma	1	Get ready, Nanami!	3
1018010453	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	Ah! They showed up here again!	3
1018010454	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami	1	How many more are there? My hands are sore!	3
1018010455	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Haicma	1	Over here!	3
1018010701	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	The enemy driver has restarted the mecha. Focus all fire on it!	
1018010702	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal01.png	???	1	Follow me!	
1018010703	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Captain, they have left the trap area!	
1018010704	0			2				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Construct Captain	1	Dammit. They already knew the coordinates of the base. It's not worth it to pursue them.

1502030413	0			1				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadNuoan1.png	Young Man A	1	I should be able to recall more memories about fighting techniques.
