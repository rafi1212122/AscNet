10108	Settling Down	The temporary camp is almost done. A lot has happened, but we don't have the time to think about the past as we have just settled here. There is still a long way to go if we want more people to survive.		1		1	1		4	0

He said he would make sure the Comms Devices in the city are restored so everyone can listen to the Christmas song during Christmas. I think it's a good idea to pull everyone out of the sadness, so I accept Jack's suggestion, but I also wonder if there's anything else I can do to help.		1		1	1	1	1	0

After that, I find it hard to face the truth that I have only one bullet left. Now it seems one bullet is just enough. Thank you. You are good people.

We have to <color=#0F70BC>repair the comms device</color> asap to explore a bigger area and see if we can find the closest and safest <color=#0F70BC>evacuation point</color>.

202002	Exploration Team	I managed to build the first <color=#0F70BC>outpost</color> in a short time but find it difficult to select members for the exploration team. Everyone seems to be injured from the previous battle. Not to mention we have just settled down, and everyone is exhausted.\nWhen I'm still thinking, Abu finds me and volunteers to lead the team.\nAbu is one of the few who have gone through training and real battles in the camp. I shouldn't be worried about him, but I still hesitate. Seeing this, Abu smiles and promises, "Don't worry, Geller. I won't be too far away before the comms device is repaired. And I'll make sure to immediately inform you if anything happens."\nHearing what Abu says, I finally agree as there is no better plan.	Story Event	1		1	1	1	202003	0

202004	Comms Device	The construction of <color=#0F70BC>the comms device</color> is finally complete. And we are finally able to detect <color=#0F70BC>exploration points further away</color>. But an evacuation comms message finds us almost at the same time. The message shows that there is a relatively safe <color=#0F70BC>evacuation point</color> right on the other side of the <color=#0F70BC>mountains in the south</color> of the camp. It's now occupied by powerful Scavengers, who will help people evacuate to safe areas in the south. But further exploration is needed to determine the specific location of the evacuation point.

No matter how difficult the battle was, they were always there for each other and will accompany each other in the future.\nAbu wants to take Joy with him and I have no reason to refuse him. Not to mention Joy is a brilliant fighter. So I immediately start to get prepared to bring Joy to him.	Story Event	1			1	1	202011	0

Rarely do I remember how luxury 'home' is," he smiles and continues, "Although we had relatively fixed camps, we are still birds of passage, moving around all the time... Geller, how I wish we could have our own houses. Better with a courtyard before the front door and a tree in it. Better be a fruit tree. It doesn't have to be big. I can sleep on the tree, and my horse can be tied to the tree. When she has her own babies, I can let them run around in the courtyard. Geller, how I wish we could have our own houses."

202016	The Sea in the South	There is no better candidate than Abu in the camp, so I have to give him the mission to search for the evacuation point. Abu agrees without hesitation. He gets excited after knowing the evacuation point is on the south of the mountain. He grew up in the south and feels like the mission is a good chance for him to return home. He keeps talking about the food, flower fields, warm wind, and boundless sea that I have never seen.\n"Even Joy didn't have the chance to see the sea," he promises me happily, "I'll make sure to show you around when we arrive in the south."

I'm thrilled that you responded almost immediately after we sent out the message!" The youthful voice is speaking seriously at a fast pace, "This is the northern camp. We were attacked by the Corrupted, so we abandoned the camp and started to evacuate to the south...

It's said that it appears every summer across the sky just like a dream. But I only read about it, because there is no aurora after I was born. Only elder people have seen it.

But Looking down, we can still see numerous wriggling, red points on the mountain road.\nI ask Abu to go back to the camp, but he refuses.\n"Geller, I know what you're trying to say. The exploration team can bring the resources back, but someone has to stay. And I'm that person. If we all retreat down the mountain, I can't promise you that we can get here again so easily.

2020600	Cliff Lake	After meeting Abu, the team is attacked when crossing the lake. The gunshots and screams attract more Corrupted. They come at us in a large group like flies flying to rotten meat.\nSeeing the team almost getting buried by the sea of the Corrupted, Abu grits his teeth and loosens up Joy's reins. He kisses his little horse the last time and then slaps hard on its back. Joy neighs and gallops off to the north with the Corrupted chasing after it. The team seizes the opportunity and reaches the opposite bank in a short time.\nAbu explains to me calmly. In the end, he says softly, "Geller, my Joy is gone... She didn't get the chance to give birth to her foals or see the sea in the south, but I have to move on. We are gonna get home soon."	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2020601	0

2020700	Mountain Valley	I receive the message from the team the next day after it arrived at the valley. This time, it's from Noah. According to him, the team just finished a fight and established communication with the evacuation point in the south. The evacuation point promised to build a safer evacuation channel for the entire camp to leave after the team reaches the evacuation point and confirms our camp's coordinates.\n"And," Noah swallows. I already know what he is about to say. Just when I want to hang up, Noah's voice breaks into my ear, "Abu... was shot... He was covering us..."\nI can hardly hear what he says next. I can't hear anything except the sharp ringing in my ears. The entire world suddenly feels like a horrible nightmare.	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2020701	0

We thought there was no hope. But guess what? A kid who claimed to be from a northern camp showed up on the battlefield with Joy and supplies!"\n"It's a shame that you were not there! The way the kid and Joy fought together was amazing! I've never seen a fighter as flexible as he was in my entire life. Except Abu, of course. Abu without the injury is way better than that kid."\n"... Geller, why is it always me talking? Don't you have something to say? Hello? Can you hear me?"\n...

A robot with its left chest and lower body missing is still rolling its eyes.\nThe safe room at the deepest part of the building was locked from the inside, but it's not much harder than eating an apple to break the door. The room is littered with supplies. On the chair in the center of the room sits a person. The gun in his hand and the hole in his head are not enough to tell his story. Only the intermittent recording keeps playing, "I want to... go... home."\n... The situation of the transfer depot makes me worry if the resource depot is still standing.

The team moves deep into the building without too much trouble and arrives at the entrance under the guidance of Abu. The entrance is blocked by numerous corpses with a pool of blood in front. And there are people inside the basement.\nIt's hard to imagine how these half-grown-ups survived everything. When Abu finds them, they huddle together with the girl who seems to be the oldest among them standing in front. She is shaking with a broken metal rod in her hands.\nAbu covers their eyes while taking them outside. But the sound of shoes stepping on the pool of blood is still loud. The kids are crying silently as if they are afraid to wake up something.	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2021001	0

He keeps saying that it would be great if Geller, I, were there, and even better if Joy were there as well. "Joy would be thrilled." Abu says, "We have to bring her with us next time."\n...

The pure and sacred beauty of the church leaves us all speechless for a moment.\n"This is so beautiful." Nico crouches down and touches the lilies.\n"Humans pray to God or hold sacred vow ceremonies in places like this. Have you got anyone that you want to make a vow to, Captain?"

She is now just an AI living in the comms device, who can only chat with me or play some table games with us at most.\n"AI will not die as long as we have a device with a memory that stores data. Let's find a device with a large memory to store Gina's source data, Captain." Nico scratched her head and said, "Build a Gina Gen 2 AI for me."\n"No problem, smart girl. But how can we find that device without the support of the organization?" I tapped Nico's little head.\nActually, I think there is no need to do so, because Gina's source database is in Nordin.\nNrodin should be the safest place right now.

2050100	Unread Comms	"Dear Captain of the Scavengers, there are a great number of the Corrupted wandering <color=#0F70BC>due east</color> of the Hexagon Island. Their behavior resembles the observing and probing actions of beasts before hunting. A <color=#FF0033>Red Tide Invasion</color> is estimated to take place in <color=#0F70BC>10 to 20 days</color>. It would probably be the biggest attack in the history of the island and leave no survivors. As the island is far from the continent and has had no contact with us for three years, its situation is unknown to us. Please go there and save the islanders asap. Tap to download the Red Tide Data Analysis attached>>\nBabylonia Command Post"\nYou have no idea when the message will be received. It seems as if the comms depot on the Hexagon Island were a fake. Looking at the 100th message that failed to get out, you give up the idea of using the comms device. Better find another chance to load the attachment. You and your Scavengers were already exhausted after the long journey, so you decided to camp at an island near the main one and <color=#0F70BC>demolish the ruins</color> to get materials for now and plan island exploration tomorrow.\nYou took an abandoned building as your temporary shelter on this island.

2050110	Speak of the Devil	You are full of energy after a night's sleep. You have to build 1 <color=#0F70BC>outpost</color> today and hurry to the Hexagon Island to gather information and search for supplies.\nThe sound of an argument outside interrupts your thinking. You get up and your assistant comes in.\n"Captain! Two islanders just came to our door, saying that they were the guardians of the island and the island chief would like to know our reason to stay. They asked to see you immediately. Arrogant." The assistant clenches the fist. "I told them we came here to help, but they didn't believe me!"\nHearing this, you have made your decision.

2050113	Removing Misunderstanding	You straighten up your clothes and walk out. You notice that the islanders seem to be alerted by the Scavenger badge on your chest.\n"Scavenger officer, may I ask why you came to the Haxegon Island?" One of the islanders asks. You cut to the chase and explain the danger the island is about to face and that you're here to help.\n"Although the Hexagon Island is a lonely island, after three years of construction, it now has a thick, tall wall on each side with a gate on each wall. As long as the gates are closed, we will be able to prevent any danger from coming in. Right. Take the pass. Don't lose it. Otherwise, you won't be able to enter or leave the island." Saying so, the islander hands you a pass and invites you to <color=#0F70BC>form an exploration team</color> to enter the Hexagon Island and check out the fortifications.\n"You have to have the pass to enter and leave the island freely. You can leave if you don't have any questions." Another islander says, leaving some island specialties as a gift for you. It seems that the camp is obviously short of supplies.

You ask the islanders to take you to the island and work out a rescue plan with the island chief.\nThe islanders laugh a bit and say, "Although the Hexagon Island is a lonely island, after three years of construction, it now has a thick, tall wall on each side with a gate on each wall. As long as the gates are closed, we will be able to prevent any danger from coming in. Right. Take the pass. Don't lose it. Otherwise, you won't be able to enter or leave the island."

2050200	Smart Gate One	You took the pass and arrived at the Hexagon Island. "Welcome, Scavenger officer. I'm Mercy, the island chief here. I'm in charge of everything on the island. I heard that you came a long way to help us. A kind person indeed." A robust, middle-aged man walks up to you with a friendly smile. He seems reliable with pleasant manners.\nYou explain why you decided to come in the hope that he can evacuate the islanders and tell you something about the comms depot. But he deliberately changes the topic to the fortifications. He points at the walls, "Have a look at our fortifications. These walls are 9 meters high with a high-power particle cannon every 3 meters up. I believe they are enough to defend against most of the monster attacks." Just when you want to say something, the two islanders you met yesterday drag you to a facility and say, "Officer, why don't you try out our special event? It's called the 'Hexagon Warrior' trial. The participants are going to be measured in terms of 6 combat abilities, namely 'intelligence, survival, strength, combat, defense, and weapon'. It was held once every three years. And we once even had three hundred Scavengers competing for the prize, the ticket of the Nighter."\nSmart Gate One used to be the venue for the trial of intelligence. The islanders draw a question for you. The question seems easy at first glance but is actually difficult, testing the knowledge of operations research. You don't know how to react. The island chief pats your shoulder and says, "Haha, easy, they just wanted to introduce you to our culture. I'll send some islanders to help you fix everything back at your camp. And we'll talk after you settle down." The island chief turns around and leaves. You decide to:	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2050203	0	2050204	0

2050300	Survival Gate Two	You keep moving with the pass and arrive at the second Defense Gate. You have slowed down the pace of the rescue plan after the island chief introduced their solid, advanced fortifications.\n"Officer!" A familiar face appears in front of you again. It's the islander you saw on the second day. "Officer. We meet again. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Forest, your guide during your time on the island."\nSeeing him being nice, you also decide to be friendly, "Mr. Forest, do you need to repair the comms station on the island? I have teammates who are good at machina. We can help you repair it or build a new one."\n"Officer. Just call me Forest. About the comms station, it's a decision the islanders made themselves. You don't need to be bothered." Forest looks embarrassed and continues, "Why don't you have a look around the facilities and the pleasant sight? The natural hexagonal coast of this island is a world wonder." The island is really big. You and your team spend half a day wandering but still find yourselves around Gate Two.\n"Officer. Behind these gates were the competition venues. This gate was named the 'Survival Gate' as it was where the 'survival' challenge was held. And the gate number suggests the order of this challenge." Saying so, Forest leads you to an entrance and helps you put on the defensive gear. "Go. You might be able to find the supplies you want inside. It all depends on your survival skills. My personal advice is to choose the <color=#0F70BC>deserted direction</color> first."\nYou decide to:	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2050301	0	2050302	0	2050303	0

2050400	Strength Gate Three	This pass is really useful. It allows you to travel freely on the island. You arrive at Strength Gate Three and see a row of colorful cars around it. "We won't give you another one if you lose your pass." As expected, Forest shows up. "Here is where the participants drag trucks to show their strength. As the competition is stimulating, it is the competition with most Scavengers watching. Scavengers can bed and trade items during the process, but every time she would stop such behaviors..." There is temporary sadness in Forest's eyes. He quickly calms down and says, "Let's continue..."\n"By the way, the islanders who helped out at the camp said there was a big-scale attack from the Corrupted three years ago. More than half of the people were dead. And half of them were outside Scavengers. Is this true?" You ask.\n"That's correct. The 'Hexagon Warrior' competition three years ago attracted many Scavengers. Maybe attracted by the frequent human traffic at sea, the monsters stormed the entire island during the award ceremony. Those who survived built this wall to prevent similar things from happening."\n"Haha, anyways, pick a car. Let's search for some supplies along the coast.

2050500	Honor Island	In the center of the Honor Island stands an alloy column. It stands tall on this small subsidiary island as if it is supporting the sky. A beautiful lady leans on the railing, forming a harmonious picture with the setting sun. "Hmm?" The lady notices you. "Are you the leader of the Scavengers? I haven't seen an outsider for ages. I suggest you leave immediately. It's not safe here."\n"The fortifications are not bad. Should be enough to defend against the Red Tide."\n"It's never the Corrupted that you should be afraid of. It's the people! The pirates!" She suddenly raises her voice and then calms down. "Three years ago, the Elvist pirates in the area killed people for money. They mainly targeted the ships of the Scavengers who came to participate in the competition. I have no idea if they... or if he is still alive."\n"He?"\n"That's right. He! The pirate with an <color=#0F70BC>X-shaped scar on his left arm</color>! If he hadn't killed my family three years ago, I wouldn't have..."\nYou express your condolences and comfort her. And then, you ask her why she told you this.\n"My name is Beverly. I'm an outsider just like you. Island chief Mercy is no longer welcoming outsiders after the attack by the Corrupted three years ago. Many left here over time. Only a few stayed. But you're different. You're the first outsiders who arrived in the past three years."\n"Find me in the medical depot on the island. I work there." Beverly says and leaves.

2050600	Cultivation Area	You arrive at the cultivation area and see Forest arguing with several maritime security guards. "Why giving us so little food? Are you cutting our supplies just because of our boss's fault?" The leader says as he gets angrier, threatening to destroy the entire place. "There's going to be a blizzard tomorrow. We're doing this to get prepared for it," Seeing you, Forest suppresses his anger and says in a low voice. Just when you try to mediate, a thick, strong hand stops you.\n"I made the decision. With the blizzard tomorrow, there could be another attack from the Punishing monsters. We must have more supplies at hand to handle the crisis," The island chief says seriously, "I'm afraid other islanders wouldn't agree to let you have more."\n"That's enough. Just because your sister died because of Captain Paul three years ago, doesn't mean you can make everything difficult for all the maritime security guards. He already committed suicide. We have nothing to do with this!"\n"Humph." Island Chief Mercy's face darkens as if he is ready to eat the guards alive. Forest immediately volunteers to handle the problem and makes Mercy leave.\n"Officer. Could you please take these 5 maritime guards back to the camp? I'll give you massive supplies for your trouble!" Forest begs you in embarrassment. Seeing this, you have no choice but to accept.	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2050601	0

2050700	War Gate Four	Danger is brewing under the gray sky. You don't have much time. To make everyone aware of the gravity of the situation, you send the data analysis of the Red Tide monsters to all the islanders via the comms station. It causes panic among people. Everyone is scrambling for the few boats to escape the island. Right at this moment, the voice of the island chief comes from the broadcast.\n"Everyone, please calm down. I can assure you there is absolutely no problem in our defense system. What happened in the past will not happen again! And the Red Tide monsters won't come all at once. Through targeted strikes, we'll definitely achieve the victory," Island Chief Mercy successfully calms down the islanders, "All young islanders, please now gather at the square of the War Gate Four for further defense instructions." People start to move to War Gate Four. Beverly is among them. When you are about to call her, you see Earl moving in the opposite direction.

Overwhelming noise comes from the islanders under the platform.\n"Scavenger officer, will we be able to defend against all the monsters?"\n"Are we going to die?"\n"Will someone come and save us?"\n"Quiet!" Islander Chief Mercy says, "Show me the inherited bravery and pride! Who are we? We are the brave descendants of the pirates of Elvist! The chosen ones by the islanders of the Hexagon Island! You are warriors with all 6 combat abilities‚Äî'intelligence, survival, strength, combat, defense, and weapon'. Are you afraid of the attacks from these brainless monsters?" Mercy's words are encouraging. "Three years ago, we let our guard down and the Corrupted got in. But things are different today. We invested so much effort in building the walls and the best cannons for this day. We ask for revenge! We are gonna get them by surprise! Elvist!!!"\n"Elvist!" "Elvist!" "Elvist!"\nThe island chief and the islanders raise their arms and shout, revealing their true identity before the crisis. Later, they finalize the defense plan and distribute some supplies. This is going to be a sleepless night for everyone.	Exploration Event	1	2050704	1	1	1	2050705	0

That person is already dead."\n"What did you say?!" Beverly screams, which draws the attention of people nearby. You find an excuse and turn them away. Beverly finds it hard to believe that the Scavenger before her found the person that she has been looking for three years and that person is dead. She can't accept the reality.\n"There were maritime security guards among the islanders who went back with me to the camp. They told me that their captain was the only robust man with an X-shaped scar on the left arm and the man committed suicide due to some reason three years ago."\n"Who are we? We are the decedents of the brave Elvist pirates!" It's Mercy's motivational speech. Beverly clenches her fists and remains quiet, head down. Perhaps because of the weather, perhaps not, you just feel cold. Later, Beverly turns around, refuses your kind offer, and leaves the square.\nAt the gathering, a battle plan is made and battle supplies are distributed. It's going to be a tough night for everyone.

I want to make sure she's safe."\n"Humph. She lives with the island chief. What can possibly happen to her?"\nYou're shocked but still remain calm. "So the ticket you mentioned is not the ticket to any tourist ship, but the Nighter!"\nEarl narrows his eyes and scrutinizes you. It seems he doubts himself for a second. "Then what are you up to?"\n"I just want to get my rescue task done. Just like that. For Scavengers, staying alive is all that matters."\n"Hahaha! So hypocritical! I suggest you stay out of it. Otherwise, who knows what will happen we I catch you next time? Huh!"\nYou breathe a sigh of relief and leave. Back to the gathering, you hear Mercy saying something like "We... Pirates... Decedents..." At the gathering, a battle plan is made and battle supplies are distributed. It's going to be a tough night for everyone.	Exploration Event	1	2050708	1	1	1	2050709	0

2050805	Secret of the Island Chief	A figure walks off the boat. It's Mercy, the island chief. He enters a shattered building with a bunch of flowers in his hand. You follow him silently, hide beside the window, and listen carefully.\n"I'm sorry, my little sister. It's been three years, but I still haven't caught the person who did it."\n"My bad. I didn't stop when you told me so. Three years ago, I told them we would quit after it was done, but Paul wanted to have the ticket of the Nighter to himself. He kidnapped you with outsiders and locked you up here. I had already promised him to give him what he wanted, but the outsider murdered you directly. There is no such ticket at all. It's just a flash disk that allows you to board the Nighter. It's right on the boat sunk by the Corrupted and they could never get it. I have sent people waiting for him right there."\n"Your death anniversary is around the corner. Some of the outsiders are still alive. I'll bring them to you very soon!!! I'd never let any of them go even if I had to kill some of the innocent."\nThere is a shiver down your spine when you hear this. Does this mean that people who left the island in the past three years according to Beverly were actually killed by the island chief? Let's leave after Mercy.

Forest mentioned you to me. What's going on in the outside world? I've been a hermit for a very long time. It's said that there are Corrupted gathering around the island. What's the situation now?" You're not prepared for so many questions coming at once and don't know how to respond. Seeing your reaction, Earl suddenly says secretly, "Or, you're here for the ticket."\nYou play dumb and ask, "Ticket? What ticket?"\n"Ah, the ticket of the fishing boat in the fishery, of course!" Earl seems to try to hide something. "Anyways, Island's father, Forest, left these supplies for you," Earl changes the topic swiftly. Hearing it's from Forest, you take them directly.

When you're worrying about how to enter the comms depot, you see Island and immediately ask her to draw the attention of the guards. Your team seizes the opportunity and sneaks into the comms depot. The damage of the comms depot is not serious. After repair, the comms depot is ready for use. The signal grids are gradually filled, and you're finally able to communicate with the outside world.

It should be fine to open it for a look.\nYou open the file, and the quantity of the Red Tide is directly displayed in the form of 3D models. Seeing the result, you sit on the ground in surprise. "The... The Red Tide could destroy the entire island... There is no way that the current defense system can hold them off!"\nYou have to inform people to leave the island! With this thought, you immediately stand up and want to tell everyone to leave.	Exploration Event	1	2051002	1	1	1	2051003	0

But the support closest to you is several days away from you. There will be a Red Tide attack in one or two days. Please get prepared immediately!\nBabylonia"\nThe message ends here.

You immediately inform Forest about this. Forest and Mercy then head to the shipwreck with their people. When you are about to go there, you receive a message from Babylonia:\n"The Red Tide monsters are arriving in six directions, aiming to launch an all-out attack on the island! Please sound the alarm immediately! Stick to the last minute! Babylonia has already sent elites to support you!

According to Mercy's plan, the strongest fighting force is deployed to the Defense Gate Five in the east of the island. It is the point closest to the Red Tide. Now, you are assigned the task to deliver supplies, but you see Beverly is wearing an islander outfit and leaving the medical center.

Beverly says, crying.\n"Three years ago, we came here for the competition, for the ticket to the Nighter. I left just one day earlier and received the message that my family were killed by the pirates. My brother took a photo of a pirate's arm. There is an X-shaped scar on it... I had to come here, even at the risk of being attacked by the Corrupted. I knew they were pirates, so I worked at the medical center, thinking I can end him myself... But it's too late..." Beverly pulls her arm away from your hand.\n"Where are you going?"\n"Where? Hahaha! Across the river, I guess. But I won't go there alone. I'll make sure to go there with their companion.

As there is no powerful army around here, people can only stay behind the walls to wait for a chance to leave. Survival Gate Three is most far away from the frontline. Most of the elderly, the weak, women, and children retreated here to wait for rescue from the outside world. At this point, Earl carries a bag and blends in with the evacuation team, but according to Mercy's order, all young people should join the battle, so you decide:	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2051303	0	2051304	0

Mercy gives orders despite your presence.\n"Forest, when the rescue arrives, immediately take Island to your hometown! Or just leave here!"\nForest is surprised, "What about you, Mercy?"\n"Even if we survive this, do you think that Babylonia will spare us? Island is the daughter of you and Mary. You are an outsider.

She used to persuade the island chief to quit doing the bad things."\n"But God loves to joke. Paul kidnapped Mary during the Strength Gate competition three years ago." Forest frowns, "The island chief immediately agreed to give him the flash disk to board the ship. But what we didn't know was he was already in cahoots with an outsider. And when we were negotiating with Paul, the outsider killed Marry!!!"\n"Did you find the murderer?"\n"No. Outsiders never revealed their true identity back then. Paul also had no idea who he was. After all these years,... the island chief's hands are already full of blood. He killed every outsider who attempted to leave the island, but none of them was the murderer. Maybe the murderer already died in the invasion of the Corrupted back then. Hahaha, I hope so."\n" Earl. It's highly possible, Earl."

You're here... Great. Cross the river. Find yourself a companion. Cough... But I still want you to live." Beverly walks to you while pressing the wound in her belly. You immediately walk up and support her, "You got hurt!"\n"Humph... You should hate me... I'm the one who blew up the five gates and let the monsters in. I'm sorry. I'll make an official apology across the river. Cough..." Beverly places a small switch in your hand. "I'm dying. This is the remote control of the last Louis II bomb. Cough... You decide how you're gonna see me." Beverly says. The white flower passes away.\n"Stand up!" Suddenly, a gun is pointed at your head. You stand up slowly. "Earl! He has nothing to do with this! Let him go!" Forest arrives with the guards. "Dad! Uncle Earl! Boohoo! Everyone on the island is dead!" Island was brought here by the island chief's guard to find Forest here, but the island chief is probably dead... "Stop right there." Forest warns Island and the others.\nAt this moment, you decide to:	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2051601	0	2051603	0

Once I spot your weakness, you'll do anything for me! Hahaha! Poor Mercy told me the location of the flash disk, begging me to spare his daughter. But how can I spare someone who saw my face?" Earl laughs hard when he sees the look on Forest's face.\n"You killed Mom! I'm gonna bite you to death!" Hearing this, Island, who was previously stunned, bites Earl's arm and won't let go.\n"You asked for it!" "Don't!" Earl shoots at Island's back. Island's body falls like a deflated ball and lies silently on the ground. Forest fires continuously at Earl's chest in anger.\n"Island! No! Island!" Forest kneels next to Island in great sorrow.

An islander suddenly runs to us, trying to get the island chief back to lead them to fight the battle.\n"Leave it to me!" Forest steps forward, "I'll make sure he pays for it with his life!

2060200	Mangshan Pass	It gets cold early in the mountain. By the time we arrived, it was already snowing. The heavy snow has blocked the roads, but there are still Scavengers trying to climb up the mountain. I stand by the mountain, watching them. Some fall and get up. Some roll down the mountain. That's when I know where the abandoned supplies came from and that people can fall from the mountain just like luggage.\nIt's too dangerous to go directly up the mountain. My friends and I are trying to find another way. We pick up the supplies on the ground to make them useful. I search for wood in the snow while listening to Jersey laughing and commenting on the climbers, "There are so many homeless people in this world. Everyone wants to go home. And I'm just one of them, right?"\nHis words sound weird. It's as if he is justifying what he has been doing, but for what?	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2060201	0

2060400	Mountain Farm	It's said that this place used to be a productive farm. When the corn in the field was ripe, it would look like a golden sea in the distance. But this is only scenery that the elderly recall. Unfortunately, the road from here up the mountain in the south is collapsed. We have to stay here overnight and find another way up. I can't believe that I'm kind of used to it.\nThere were other Scavengers when we arrived at the camp. They said they were just having some rest here.\n"If you want to camp at Mangshan, then you've got to visit the <color=#0F70BC>military facility</color> in the west. There you can find some equipment to help you climb the mountain. And then, you take the <color=#0F70BC>west mountain road</color>, pass the <color=#0F70BC>health center</color>, and you'll arrive at Mangshan."	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2060401	0

2060510	Collapsed Road	With the map found at the military facility, we managed to find a way through. We got out of the forest and found several Scavengers before us. After talking to them, we found that most of them arrived here days ago and temporarily camped here due to the constant battle in the south. But now the battle is over, and they are ready to set off again.\n"South?" Jersey spots the keyword in the Scavenger's words. "From here to the south is Mangshan. Are you saying that Mangshan is under attack?"\n"Yeah," the Scavenger scratches his head and sighs, "It's very strange. The Corrupted seem to be attracted by something. All of them are coming this way. Mangshan just happens to be on the path... What? Are you guys planning to go there?"\nJersey grits his teeth tightly. The Scavenger seems to see his anxiety and shows us the location of the medical camp. It's said that the camp is sheltering all the injured in the battle at Mangshan.

Some Scavengers from the Health Center came days ago and gave us plenty of medicine. And the Corrupted withdrew in the middle of the battle.

2061200	Warship Remains	As Jersey recalls, the warship has been here for as long as he can remember. All useful supplies in it were taken. This is why it's weird that there are so many Corrupted around here.\n"It seems they are not attracted by the warship 'itself' but something in the distance." Jersey warns us while observing the movement of the Corrupted, "Better be careful if we are going further ahead."	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2061201	0

2061310	Military Facility	Almost the entire facility is surrounded by the Corrupted. A horrible smell of blood gone bad can be smelled throughout the building. This place has already become the nest of the Corrupted. After investigation, we found a map with which we could go down Mangshan, and we are almost certain that the Corrupted were attracted by the signal transmitter in the center of the facility. We can stop them from coming if we can shut the transmitter down.\n"I can handle this if you trust me." Jersey says, "I have an idea how to shut down the device and leave unscathed. Of course, you can do it yourself or leave it like this, but I have to remind you that regardless of your choice, once I open this door, there will be a riot of the Corrupted. It might even affect the camp. If lucky, the riot will only last one or two days. If not, then no one knows how long it will last."\nJersey says and looks at me, "I'll let you decide."

I have no idea how he managed to go around them.\nA moment later, the Corrupted suddenly make a puzzled sound and disperse as if they received some sort of a silent order. The riot didn't take place. Everything went smoothly.\n"I didn't imagine that... I could help others someday." Jersey returns to the team while watching the Corrupted leaving with a mysterious smile, "Hero? No, I'm not a hero. The honor isn't mine... But I would still like to thank you for letting me be a hero for a moment."	Exploration Event	1		1	1	1	2061315	0

We fought our way to the center of the facility, turned off the signal generator, and left at the last minute.\nThe facility exploded. Although the Corrupted started to leave, the Corrupted trapped in the facility was set free, which led to a temporary Red Tide outbreak.	Exploration Event	1		1	1	1	2061317	0

2061400	Transfer Station	This transfer station was originally one of the important stations on the northern transportation railway. But now there are only two tracks left to indicate its previous identity. Some other Scavengers set up a temporary camp here. Most of them came here according to the information they got in the southern signal station just like us, but not everyone is as lucky as we are. Lives broken by disaster stand one by one, with one more miserable than the other.\n"Suffering is the most ancient and loyal sheepdog. People are just sheep who are forced to run before they can even walk properly." Perhaps seeing our sympathy for the injured, Jersey comments calmly, "The real battlefield is way more tragic than this, but there is no way to save everyone we encounter. So we have to move on. Don't let it get to you."\nHowever, most of the people here are willing to share their supplies with others even if they're struggling to live. We have thus received a lot of help. I sincerely hope that all <color=#0F70BC>those who help others</color> can be blessed by fate the same way.	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2061401	0

2061500	Abandoned Hotel	It always gets cold early in the mountains. After a busy day, many team members start to show symptoms of a cold. We have to stay overnight in this abandoned hotel.\nIt must have been converted into a wartime base before. The interior structure has been completely changed with traces of battles all over. Fragments of maps and flags are scattered around on the floor. I look around but only find a few supplies. Just when I want to tell everyone to rest, I see Jersey standing before a cob wall, asking me to get over.\n"There is a hidden room behind this wall. If there are any supplies in this place, they could only be hidden inside." Jersey has caught a cold. There is a heavy nasal in his voice, but he sounds determined. "Believe me. I know this structure."\nI knock on the wall he points at, but it doesn't sound empty. But Jersey looks pretty familiar with this place. Should I believe him?

There is a space behind the wall. There are not many supplies, but this is better than nothing.\n"I'm impressed, Jersey. How did you know there is a hidden space?"\n"I... I've been to the battlefield. But this trick became obsolete a long time ago. Nostalgic."	Exploration Event	1		1	1	1	2061504	0

2061600	Temporary Camp	Jersey fell ill. We had to pass a night at this temporary camp again. The good news is that we can see the <color=#0F70BC>hiking trail</color> by Mangshan. It should be safer if we go up from there.\nPerhaps exhausted due to his illness, Jersey looks more relaxed and reveals his past to us for the first time.\nHe returns to Mangshan to find his lover. His camp was attacked. He and his lover got separated. The two agreed to meet again in their hometown. He waited until everything settled and finally embarked on the way back home.\n"Is there someone you have to meet again no matter what happens, officer?" Jersey asks me. His eyes look terribly bright even though he is sick. "I do. So I'll live <color=#0F70BC>at all costs</color>. I'll live and then we will definitely meet again."

The medicine racks are almost dust free.\nIt seems that the supermarket has been welcoming visitors even recently. It's very likely there are other survivors ahead. So we take part of the supplies and leave the remaining to other Scavengers.	Exploration Event	1			1	1	2062201	0

2062300	Park Management Office	Not surprisingly, a bunch of Scavengers have already made it a temporary base. This small room is full of patients and has a mixed smell of medicines, blood, and disinfectant.\n"This is enough," a woman leader drops the curtain and stops us before the ward, "This is only one of the countless refugee clinics. Nothing special. It's said that there is some sort of signal station in the south. My husband is already out to look for it. He says he'll be back soon."\n"There's nothing I can help.

2062500	Black Lighthouse	The lighthouse was already damaged a long time ago, like a dark cloud lurking by the lake. To be more specific, this is not actually a "lake".

2062600	Lakeside Cave	The cave is deep and wet. It's hard to tell if the water was naturally generated or left by something. It gives us a feeling of walking inside the belly of some sort of giant monster.\nWe find a small camp deep in the cave. Perhaps because of its location, the camp is almost intact except for some glowing bugs crawling around. Even the <color=#0F70BC>supply chests</color> are neatly piled up with no traces of being forced open. On top of the chests is a notebook with distorted writing on one of the pages.\n\n<color=#0F70BC><i>Sorry but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live. Sorry, but I want to live.

2062700	Abandoned Industrial Park	It's said that it used to be the biggest industrial area in the north with numerous factories and giant chimneys, making it look like a gray forest in the north of the city. But everything is gone now.\nDuring our exploration, we find a map of the surrounding area. There are two arrows extending from the industrial park, one pointing to the <color=#0F70BC>northeast</color> of the park, and one pointing to the <color=#0F70BC>south</color>. Through investigation, we are almost sure that there are traces of <color=#0F70BC>survivors</color> in the <color=#0F70BC>northwest</color> of the park. Should we have a look there?
